28520736	FBgn0262451	BANTAM	In this study we set out to examine the role of the bantam (ban) microRNA in the regulation of NB homeostasis in the Drosophila brain. We show that ban is a direct transcriptional target of the N signaling pathway, and that ban feedback regulates N through negative regulation of its target mRNA numb, which encodes an inhibitor of N. We show that this feedback regulation of N helps maintain the robustness of NB cell fate. Our results further show that ban also impinges on a Numb-Myc axis of cell growth regulation, apparently in a N-independent manner, thus revealing novel mechanisms in NSC regulation by the N signaling network. These findings have important implications for both the basic biology of NSCs and the therapeutic intervention of cancers caused by deregulated Numb-N signaling.
28520736	FBgn0002973	NUMB	We next sought to identify the target of ban that participates in the regulatory network underlying NB fate determination. Although numb 3'-UTR has been reported to contain two predicted ban binding sites [18], the ban binding site(s) responsible for numb translational repression remains to be determined. Using the RNAHybrid program [25] for miRNA target prediction, we identified several candidate ban-binding sites in Drosophila numb mRNA 3´-UTR as well as CDS (S5A Fig). In translational reporter assays, the addition of numb 3´-UTR made the translation of the luciferase reporter specifically sensitive to the presence of ban but not let-7 miRNA (Fig 4A). Mutating the seed sequence in a best-predicted ban-binding site in numb 3´-UTR, which is distinct from the two predicted sites reported previously [18], abolished the sensitivity of the reporter to ban (Figs 4A and S5B). These results suggest that numb mRNA is a potential target of ban. To gather in vivo evidence of ban regulation of numb, we first examined the effect of ban LOF and GOF on endogenous Numb expression. Western blot and qRT-PCR analyses showed that in banΔ1 mutant or when ban-sp was ubiquitously expressed, levels of Numb protein (Fig 4B) and mRNA (S5C Fig) expression were significantly increased in the brain, whereas ban OE led to a moderate reduction of Numb protein and mRNA levels (Figs 4B and S5C).
28520736	FBgn0002973	NUMB	We next examined the in vivo functional relationship between ban and numb in NB regulation. Knockdown of numb by RNAi in type II NB lineages resulted in enlarged nucleolar size in newly born IPs, and numb RNAi rescued the nucleolar size reduction caused by ban-sp OE (Fig 2D and 2E). Importantly, the nucleolar size increase caused by numb RNAi was Myc-dependent (Fig 2D and 2E; S6A–S6C Fig), as in ban OE case (Fig 2A and 2C). These results support the notion that Numb is a key target mediating the effect of ban on nucleolar growth.
28520736	FBgn0030674	HUWE1	Numb has previously been shown to regulate transcription factor stability by stimulating E3 ligase activity [26]. We found that the effect of Numb in promoting Myc degradation was attenuated by knocking down Huwe1 in HEK293 cells (S7D and S7E Fig). In fly larval brain, Huwe1 RNAi resulted in increased nucleolar sizes of NBs and IPs in type II NB lineages in a Myc-dependent manner (S8A–S8C Fig). Moreover, Huwe1 functionally interacted with Numb and Myc to regulate type II NB maintenance, as indicated by the ability of Huwe1 RNAi to facilitate Myc in rescuing the type II NB loss caused by Numb OE (S8D and S8E Fig).
28520736	FBgn0002973	NUMB	To examine the effect of ban on Numb protein expression specifically in NBs, we first examined Numb protein expression in the NBs in ban LOF and GOF FLP-out clones. Our results showed that Numb expression level change in the NBs displays similar trends as detected by the western blot analysis of brain tissues (S9A and S9B Fig), although the difference did not achieve statistical significance. This may be due to the sensitivity of the immunostaining method, the specificity of the antibody, or the relatively high basal expression of Numb in the otherwise wild type NBs. Consistent with the last scenario, when we examined Numb expression in N-V5 overexpression NBs that have lower basal level of Numb, the effect of ban-sp in elevating endogenous Numb expression became more significant (S10A and S10B Fig). This result further supports the notion that the translation of numb mRNA is regulated by ban in vivo.
28520736	FBgn0262656	DMYC	To further test for a critical role of Numb in mediating the effects of ban on N activity and CSC-like growth, we performed genetic epistasis experiments. First, we found that the effect of ban inhibition by ban-sp in attenuating N activity was mediated by Numb, as numb RNAi or removal of one copy of numb (Fig 5A and 5B; S11A and S11B Fig) blocked the ban-sp effect. In contrast, removal of one copy of pros or brat, two other genes that were recently identified as ban targets that regulate normal NB growth and proliferation [18], was without effect (S11A andS11C–S11E Fig). Consistently, numb RNAi or removing one copy of numb, but not pros or brat, effectively rescued the effect of ban-sp in attenuating ectopic NB formation and tumor-like growth induced by N hyperactivation (Fig 5C and 5D). In N-OE condition, numb RNAi or removing one copy of numb alone had no obvious effect on NB number (S12A and S12B Fig). Moreover, promotion of cell growth by Myc-OE, but not cell cycle progression by Cyclin E-OE, which failed to affect nucleolar growth (S12C and S12D Fig), suppressed the effect of ban-sp on ectopic NB formation and tumorous growth (Fig 5E). Consistent with Huwe1 being a negative regulator of dMyc, Huwe1 RNAi also suppressed the effect of ban-sp on ectopic NB number and tumorous growth (S12E and S12F Fig). Together, these results suggest that at least in N-induced CSC-like NB growth and proliferation, Numb is a key target that mediates the effect of ban, and cell growth conferred by the Numb-Myc axis is a key mechanism of NB homeostasis regulation by ban.

28520736	FBgn0002973	NUMB	Our results emphasize the critical role of translational control mechanisms in NSCs and CSC-like NSCs. Compared to the heavily studied transcriptional control, our knowledge of the translational control of NSCs and CSCs is rather limited. As fundamental regulators of mRNA translation, miRNAs can interact with both positive and negative regulators of translation to influence gene expression [36, 37]. Thus, miRNA activity can be regulated context-dependently at both the transcriptional and translational levels, which may account for the opposite effect of N on ban activity in the fly brain and wing disc [38], although the ban genomic locus is bound by Su(H) in both tissues. Whether N regulates the transcription of ban or its activity as a translational repressor in the wing disc remains to be tested. With regard to the translation of numb mRNA, the conserved RNA-binding protein (RNA-BP) Musashi [39] has been shown to critically regulate the level of Numb protein in mammalian hematopoietic SCs and leukemia SCs [40, 41]. Further investigation into the potential interplay between miRNAs and RNA-BPs in the translational control of Numb in NBs and CSC-like NBs promises to reveal new mechanisms and logic in stem cell homeostasis regulation, with important implications for stem cell biology and cancer biology.
24945799	FBgn0000449	DIB	We recently characterized cis-regulatory elements required for the expression of phm and dib in the Drosophila PG [20], including a 69 bp promoter element located in the upstream phm region and a 86 bp region in the third intron of dib. These elements are important for the temporal up-regulation of phm and dib by Br isoform 4 (Br-Z4) that increases the ecdysteroidogenic capacity of the PG and allows the production of the high-level ecdysone pulse that triggers pupariation. To further characterize the tissue-specific regulation of the ecdysone biosynthetic pathway, we analyzed PG specific regulatory elements for the presence of transcription factor binding sites.
24945799	FBgn0000449	DIB	Here, we report a novel role for Ventral veins lacking (Vvl) and Knirps (Kni) in regulating ecdysteroidogenesis in Drosophila. The cis-regulatory elements responsible for PG specific expression of spok, phm and dib contain conserved Vvl and Kni binding sites. Expression of vvl is high in the PG compared to the whole animal, while kni expression is less PG-specific. Knock down of vvl and kni in the PG results in larval developmental arrest due to impaired ecdysone production. We show that Vvl and Kni specifically regulate expression of all the ecdysone biosynthetic enzymes through functionally important regulatory sites. Furthermore, we find that Molting defective (Mld) specifically regulates enzymes that catalyze early steps in the ecdysone biosynthetic pathway. Our study identifies Vvl as a PG cell-specific transcription factor that underlies steroidogenic cell function. We conclude that Vvl and Kni are involved in the transcriptional regulatory network of the PG that coordinates expression of biosynthetic enzymes required for ecdysone production during Drosophila development.

24945799	FBgn0000449	DIB	We analyzed the phm and dib PG specific regulatory elements for transcription factor binding sites. Our in silico search revealed conserved binding sites for the POU-domain transcription factor Vvl and the nuclear receptor Kni in the phm promoter and dib enhancer (Fig. 1A and S1). Analysis of the phm promoter identified one conserved Vvl site and four Kni sites of which three are highly conserved, indicating that they are important regulatory sites. In support of this, mutations disrupting the Vvl site and one of the conserved Kni sites eliminate PG specific GFP reporter expression [20]. In contrast, mutations in the non-conserved Kni binding sites do not reduce PG expression. The third intron dib enhancer also contains one Vvl site and two Kni sites, both in regions that have been conserved. We also identified a 300 bp PG specific promoter for spok, encoding an enzyme that acts at an early step in the ecdysone biosynthetic pathway [9]. This element located −331 to −32 bp upstream of translation start drives specific PG reporter GFP expression. This spok promoter contains three Vvl and three Kni binding sites, although these sites are less conserved compared to the Vvl and Kni sites identified in the phm and dib regulatory elements. Expression of spok has previously been reported to require Molting defective (Mld), a nuclear zinc finger protein [9]. Since the DNA binding sequence motif for Mld has not yet been characterized, we were unable to examine potential Mld binding sites in the spok promoter.

This spok promoter contains three Vvl and three Kni binding sites, although these sites are less conserved compared to the Vvl and Kni sites identified in the phm and dib regulatory elements. Expression of spok has previously been reported to require Molting defective (Mld), a nuclear zinc finger protein [9]. Since the DNA binding sequence motif for Mld has not yet been characterized, we were unable to examine potential Mld binding sites in the spok promoter.
24945799	FBgn0000568	E75B	If kni and vvl are involved in specifying the gland during embryonic development, reducing their expression may cause a lack of PG cell differentiation. We used a phm>GFP to label and examine the morphology of the PG in L1 larvae 36 hours after egg lay (AEL). PG cell number and morphology of L1 larvae with reduced expression of vvl, kni or mld in the PG were indistinguishable from the phm>+ control (Fig. 2A). This demonstrates that knock down of these factors does not compromise PG cell fate specification and survival. The developmental arrest indicates that loss of vvl and kni in the PG impair the cellular production of ecdysone. We therefore investigated the ecdysone levels in L1 larvae 36 hours AEL by measuring E75B mRNA expression in the whole animal, which has been used as a readout for ecdysone levels [20], [23]. Expression of E75B was significantly reduced in mid-first instar phm>vvl-RNAi and phm>mld-RNAi larvae compared to the control (Fig. 2B). This is consistent with the failure of phm>vvl-RNAi and phm>mld-RNAi larvae to molt to the L2 stage. A portion of larvae with knock down of kni in the PG undergoes the L1–L2 transition, suggesting that some of these animals can produce sufficient ecdysone for the L1–L2 molt. Consistent with this observation, knock down of kni in the PG did not lead to a significant reduction of E75B in the mid-first instar. To demonstrate that the observed phenotypes are a result of decreased ecdysone biosynthesis, we tested if ecdysone supplementation could rescue the developmental arrest. Indeed, animals with reduced expression of vvl, kni or mld in the PG were rescued by the addition of 20E to their food, showing that it is the lack of this hormone that is causing the arrest (Fig. 2A). To confirm this, we measured the ecdysteroid titer, which demonstrates that larvae with reduced expression of vvl, kni or mld in the PG have lower levels of ecdysteroids by the mid-first instar compared with the control (Fig. 2C). Taken together, these results indicate that the transcription factors Vvl and Kni, like Mld, are required for ecdysone biosynthesis in the endocrine cells of PG during early larval development.
24945799	FBgn0086917	SPOK	We next investigated if Vvl and Kni regulate the expression of the genes involved in ecdysone biosynthesis. phm>vvl-RNAi and phm>kni-RNAi larvae showed reduction in the expression of phm, dib and sad by the mid-first instar 36 hours AEL compared to the control (Fig. 3A). Knock down of vvl also reduced expression of sro and spok, encoding enzymes believed to work in early steps in the pathway known as the black box [4], [5], [9]. However, expression of nvd, encoding a PG specific gene involved in the first step in the biosynthetic pathway, was not significantly reduced in the mid-first instar by knock down of vvl or kni in the PG. This further supports the notion that the PG is specified normally during embryogenesis. Previous studies have indicated that mld mutants have reduced ecdysone levels because of a specific lack of spok expression [9], [21]. Our knock down results involving mld-RNAi in the PG support that Mld is required specifically for the expression of spok, but not for the later acting products of phm, dib and sad.
24945799	FBgn0283451	BR-Z4	The data indicate that Vvl and Kni are critical for the steroidogenic activity of the PG during early post-embryonic development. Later during larval development the up-regulation of ecdysone biosynthetic genes and the growth of the gland are required to produce the high-level ecdysone pulse that triggers metamorphosis. To investigate the role of Vvl and Kni during later stages of postembryonic development, we analyzed their expression in third instar (L3) larval ring glands from early (72 hours AEL), mid (96 hours AEL) and late (120 hours AEL) L3 larvae. In wild type larvae, expression of the steroidogenic genes showed no or little increase from the early to mid L3, but a dramatic up-regulation in the late L3 (Fig. 4A), coinciding with the high-level ecdysone peak that triggers pupariation 120 hours AEL [20]. While the expression of vvl showed only a minor increase during the L3 stage, a stronger up-regulation of kni and mld was observed. Compared to both vvl, kni and mld, expression of Br-Z4 was highly up-regulated in the late L3 consistent with its role in the temporal up-regulation of the biosynthetic genes important for the high-level ecdysone pulse 120 hours AEL that triggers pupariation [24]. Considering the tissue-specificity and that vvl expression in the PG shows little relation with the ecdysone titer, it seems likely that Vvl is important for the spatial control of ecdysone biosynthetic gene expression in the PG, but not for the temporal regulation during development. On the other hand, kni expression is less PG specific, but show more correlation with the ecdysone titer during L3.
24945799	FBgn0086680	VVL	Taken together, the data suggest that the coordinated expression of steroidogenic enzymes in the PG requires Vvl and Kni function. To further corroborate our findings that Vvl and Kni are involved in co-regulating all components in the biosynthetic pathway, we examined whether supplementation of any 20E precursors to the larval growth medium was able to rescue the developmental arrest of vvl or kni RNAi larvae. When fed cholesterol, 7-dehydrocholesterol or 5β-ketodiol, most phm>vvl-RNAi and phm>kni-RNAi animals develop to small L2 larvae (Fig. 5A and B). Since phm>vvl-RNAi and phm>kni-RNAi arrest in L1 and L2 without supplementation, it appears that increasing the amount of substrate for ecdysone synthesis provides some compensation, but not complete rescue, when the pathway activity is reduced. Supporting this notion, providing intermediates further downstream in the pathway gradually increased rescue of phm>vvl-RNAi and phm>kni-RNAi larvae to the L3 stage. In particular, 20E and its precursor ecdysone efficiently rescue phm>vvl-RNAi and phm>kni-RNAi larvae to the L3 stage (Fig. 5B).
24945799	FBgn0086917	SPOK	Supplying the 5β-ketodiol and 5β-ketotriol, but not cholesterol or 7-dehydrocholesterol, rescued mld-RNAi larvae (Fig. 5B), consistent with Mld being required for expression of Nvd and Spok which mediate early steps in the pathway upstream of the 5β-ketodiol. We conclude, that Vvl and Kni are necessary for coordinating the tissue-specific expression of all steroidogenic genes in the endocrine cells of the PG, while Mld specifically regulates genes involved in early steps in the pathway responsible for the conversion of cholesterol to the 5β-ketodiol, an intermediate downstream of the black box reaction(s).
24945799	FBgn0024320	NPC1A	Finally, we investigated whether loss of vvl and kni in the PG affects cholesterol substrate delivery for ecdysone synthesis. Surprisingly, we found that, whereas the biosynthetic genes show a strong decrease, npc1a exhibits a dramatic increase in the gland of vvl-RNAi, kni-RNAi and mld-RNAi larvae (Fig. 6D). This finding indicates that up-regulation of npc1a in the PG of vvl-RNAi, kni-RNAi and mld-RNAi larvae reflect a compensatory feedback regulation to maintain cholesterol homeostasis and/or increase substrate delivery to promote steroidogenesis. Down-regulation of biosynthetic activity in vvl-RNAi, kni-RNAi and mld-RNAi larvae reduces cholesterol flux through the ecdysone pathway and may lead to intracellular redistribution of cholesterol to maintain homeostasis through feedback regulation. We therefore explored the possibility that npc1a, which is required for normal cholesterol distribution and availability for steroid synthesis, is controlled by feedback regulation of cholesterol. Expression of npc1a is repressed by cholesterol in wild type larvae (Fig. S4), indicating that npc1a is feedback regulated. Recently, we showed that ecdysone biosynthesis is controlled by feedback circuits in the PG [20]. We therefore also examined whether ecdysone signaling in the gland is affected by knock down vvl, kni or mld. To test this, we measured mRNA levels of the ecdysone receptor (EcR) ring glands isolated from L3 larvae where vvl-RNAi, kni-RNAi or mld-RNAi had been induced in the PG during L2. Transcript levels of EcR were not affected in ring glands from vvl-RNAi and kni-RNAi larvae (Fig. S4), indicating that the responsiveness of the PG to ecdysone is not reduced. Taken together, these results suggest alterations of cholesterol uptake and trafficking in the PG when flow through the biosynthetic pathway is impaired.
24945799	FBgn0086680	VVL	The gap gene kni is known for its role in embryonic segmentation patterning and development of the trachea and wing vein [47]–[51] similar to vvl. Kni is a nuclear receptor with a zinc-finger motif that is unlikely to be ligand activated since it lacks a ligand-binding domain. Our data show that Kni is required for expression of the genes involved in ecdysone biosynthesis in the PG, suggesting that Kni functions as an activator in this situation. Although Kni is generally considered a short-range repressor [52], it is required to activate hairy expression in stripe 6 during embryogenesis [53]. Thus, Kni may act either as a repressor or as an activator in a context-dependent manner. In mammals, nuclear receptors are also key regulators of steroidogenic target genes encoding P450 enzymes [54]–[56].
24945799	FBgn0001168	HAIRY	The gap gene kni is known for its role in embryonic segmentation patterning and development of the trachea and wing vein [47]–[51] similar to vvl.

24945799	FBgn0024320	NPC1A	Interestingly, we observed that loss of vvl, kni or mld results in dramatic increase of npc1a expression in the PG. Npc1a is highly expressed in the PG where it is required for uptake and intracellular trafficking of cholesterol for steroidogeneis [26]. Larvae with loss of npc1a exhibit a punctuate pattern of sterol accumulation in the PG cells, indicating defects in cholesterol transport within the cells. Normally cholesterol is taken up as low density lipoproteins (LDLs) and trafficked within endosomes to the lysosomes where hydrolysis releases free cholesterol that is delivered to the plasma membrane and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) [61] where the first step in the conversion of cholesterol to ecdysone likely takes place. Why is npc1a up-regulated in the PG when ecdysone synthesis and pathway activity is impaired? It seems unlikely that Vvl, Kni and Mld are all involved in repression of npc1a. The block of flux through the biosynthetic pathway in the PG of vvl-RNAi, kni-RNAi and mld-RNAi animals may change intracellular cholesterol pools in the gland and affect feedback regulation to maintain cholesterol homeostasis. Our results indicate that npc1a is regulated by cholesterol suggesting that the up-regulation of npc1a may be part of a feedback regulatory response to changes in cellular cholesterol levels. This may indicate a compensatory mechanism to redistribute cholesterol by increasing storage of cholesterol esters and/or efflux to reduce free cholesterol levels when ecdysone biosynthesis is blocked. Moreover, npc1a is regulated by Br [27], a factor induced by EcR in the PG [20], implying that ncp1a may also be regulated by ecdysone feedback. Our study shows that cholesterol availability is an important parameter for ecdysone biosynthesis. Interactions between cholesterol and ecdysone feedback mechanisms may therefore be important for coordinating the supply cholesterol with the rate of steroidogenesis.
28414802	FBgn0267978	AP	The extensive genetic regulatory flows underlying specification of different neuronal subtypes are not well understood at the molecular level. The Nplp1 neuropeptide neurons in the developing Drosophila nerve cord belong to two sub-classes; Tv1 and dAp neurons, generated by two distinct progenitors. Nplp1 neurons are specified by spatial cues; the Hox homeotic network and GATA factor grn, and temporal cues; the hb -> Kr -> Pdm -> cas -> grh temporal cascade. These spatio-temporal cues combine into two distinct codes; one for Tv1 and one for dAp neurons that activate a common terminal selector feedforward cascade of col -> ap/eya -> dimm -> Nplp1. Here, we molecularly decode the specification of Nplp1 neurons, and find that the cis-regulatory organization of col functions as an integratory node for the different spatio-temporal combinatorial codes. These findings may provide a logical framework for addressing spatio-temporal control of neuronal sub-type specification in other systems.

28414802	FBgn0267978	AP	To address this issue, we have identified enhancers for Tv and dAp neuron expression for the genes in the common Tv1/dAp FFL: col, ap, eya, dimm and Nplp1. We generated transgenic reporters for these enhancers, both wildtype and mutant for specific transcription factor binding sites, to test their regulation in mutant and misexpression backgrounds. We also used CRISPR/Cas9 technology to delete these enhancers in their normal genomic location to test their necessity for gene regulation. Strikingly, we find that the distinct upstream spatio-temporal combinatorial codes, which trigger col expression in Tv1 versus dAp neurons, converge onto different enhancer elements in the col gene. Hence, the col Tv1 neuron enhancer is triggered by Antp, hth, exd, lbe and cas, while the dAp enhancer is triggered by Kr, pdm and grn. In contrast to this subset-specific enhancer set-up for col activation, the subsequent, col-driven Nplp1 FFL feeds onto common enhancers in each downstream gene. These findings reveal that distinct spatio-temporal cues, acting in different neural progenitors, can trigger the same FFL by converging on discrete enhancer elements in an initiator terminal selector, to thereby dictate the same ultimate neuronal subtype cell fate.

We generated transgenic reporters for these enhancers, both wildtype and mutant for specific transcription factor binding sites, to test their regulation in mutant and misexpression backgrounds. We also used CRISPR/Cas9 technology to delete these enhancers in their normal genomic location to test their necessity for gene regulation. Strikingly, we find that the distinct upstream spatio-temporal combinatorial codes, which trigger col expression in Tv1 versus dAp neurons, converge onto different enhancer elements in the col gene. Hence, the col Tv1 neuron enhancer is triggered by Antp, hth, exd, lbe and cas, while the dAp enhancer is triggered by Kr, pdm and grn. In contrast to this subset-specific enhancer set-up for col activation, the subsequent, col-driven Nplp1 FFL feeds onto common enhancers in each downstream gene. These findings reveal that distinct spatio-temporal cues, acting in different neural progenitors, can trigger the same FFL by converging on discrete enhancer elements in an initiator terminal selector, to thereby dictate the same ultimate neuronal subtype cell fate.
28414802	FBgn0035092	NPLP1	The Ap neurons constitute a set of interneurons in the Drosophila VNC, out of which the thoracic lateral Tv1 neurons and the dorso-medial dAp neurons express the Nplp1 neuropeptide (Fig 1A) [6, 17, 19]. Tv1 neurons are generated by NB5-6T, while dAp neurons arise from NB4-3 [6, 21]. Activation of Nplp1 in Tv1 and dAp neurons is controlled by a shared coherent FFL, consisting of col, ap, eya and dimm, where col is both necessary and sufficient to trigger the FFL [6, 21]. In contrast, this common FFL is triggered by two different upstream spatio-temporal combinatorial codes, acting in the two different NBs. In NB5-6T this includes the temporal gene castor (cas), the Hox homeotic gene Antennapedia (Antp), the two Hox co-factor genes homothorax (hth) and extradenticle (exd), as well as the homeobox gene ladybird early (lbe). In NB4-3, this includes the temporal genes Kruppel (Kr) and pdm2/nub (pdm), as well as the GATA gene grain (grn), (Fig 1B) [20–22].
28414802	FBgn0267978	AP	To identify the cell-specific cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) that act as enhancers for the five genes in the dAp/Tv1 FFL, we analyzed expression of a number of transgenic lines generated in previous studies [17, 23, 24], as well as an eya-CRM-Gal4 transgene (provided by T. Lian and D.W. Allan; S1 Fig). This resulted in identification of fragments capable of driving reporter gene expression in the Tv1 and dAp neurons. To facilitate mutagenesis of CRMs, we attempted to identify smaller genomic fragments that retained appropriate activity. This resulted in the identification of smaller (1–2 kilobases) CRMs for all genes with the exception of col, where larger fragments were required for proper expression (Fig 1C–1S, S1 Fig, S1 Data). Strikingly, we found that while one enhancer region was sufficient to recapitulate Tv1 and dAp expression of ap, eya, dimm and eya, for col we identified two distinct enhancers, one each for expression in dAp or Tv1 neurons (Fig 1C–1E and 1T).
28414802	FBgn0000320	EYA	To identify the cell-specific cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) that act as enhancers for the five genes in the dAp/Tv1 FFL, we analyzed expression of a number of transgenic lines generated in previous studies [17, 23, 24], as well as an eya-CRM-Gal4 transgene (provided by T.

28414802	FBgn0267978	AP	Next, we analyzed eya, ap, dimm and Nplp1 enhancer deletions (eyaΔCRM, apΔapS-CRM, dimmΔCRM, Nplp1ΔCRM), and observed that all exhibited strong effects. Specifically, as anticipated, all enhancer deletions resulted in significant reduction or loss of expression of the targeted gene, in both Tv1 and dAp neurons (Figs 2E, 2H and S2I–S2X). Moreover, in line with the previous genetic analysis that identified an eya/ap ->dimm ->Nplp1 FFL, deletion of the eya, ap or dimm enhancers all significantly reduced Nplp1 expression (Figs 2E–2J, S2I–S2N and S2Q–S2U). Also in line with this FFL, deletion of ap or eya enhancers did not affect one another’s expression (Figs 2F and S2J–S2P). Within the Ap cluster, while deletion of the eya enhancer affected Nplp1 expression in Tv1, we did observe Eya expression in two cells in the cluster (S2J Fig). However, analysis at AFT, using Col as a specific Tv1 marker at this stage, revealed that Eya expression was lost from the Tv1 neuron, hence explaining the strong effect on Nplp1 in eyaΔCRM mutants (S3A and S3B Fig). In line with the previous genetic analysis, dimm enhancer deletion did not affect either Eya or Ap expression (Figs 2H–2J, S2R and S2U). Finally, deletion of the Nplp1-CRM did not affect expression of Eya, Ap or Dimm (Figs 2H–2J, S2S and S2V–S2X).
28414802	FBgn0035092	NPLP1	Next, we analyzed eya, ap, dimm and Nplp1 enhancer deletions (eyaΔCRM, apΔapS-CRM, dimmΔCRM, Nplp1ΔCRM), and observed that all exhibited strong effects. Specifically, as anticipated, all enhancer deletions resulted in significant reduction or loss of expression of the targeted gene, in both Tv1 and dAp neurons (Figs 2E, 2H and S2I–S2X).

Within the Ap cluster, while deletion of the eya enhancer affected Nplp1 expression in Tv1, we did observe Eya expression in two cells in the cluster (S2J Fig). However, analysis at AFT, using Col as a specific Tv1 marker at this stage, revealed that Eya expression was lost from the Tv1 neuron, hence explaining the strong effect on Nplp1 in eyaΔCRM mutants (S3A and S3B Fig). In line with the previous genetic analysis, dimm enhancer deletion did not affect either Eya or Ap expression (Figs 2H–2J, S2R and S2U). Finally, deletion of the Nplp1-CRM did not affect expression of Eya, Ap or Dimm (Figs 2H–2J, S2S and S2V–S2X).
28414802	FBgn0000320	EYA	Next, we analyzed eya, ap, dimm and Nplp1 enhancer deletions (eyaΔCRM, apΔapS-CRM, dimmΔCRM, Nplp1ΔCRM), and observed that all exhibited strong effects.

28414802	FBgn0267978	AP	For analyzing the ap enhancer, we focused on the smaller apS2J-CRM-lacZ transgene, and placed this in the mutant background for Antp, lbe and col. Focusing on the Tv1 neurons, we observed significant reduction in β-gal expression in all three mutants (Antp, lbe and col), when compared to the enhancer transgene in a wild type background (control) stained on the same slide (Fig 5A–5E). As anticipated from the selective role of Antp, acting in the thorax, and lbe, in NB5-6T, the dAp neurons were only reduced in the thorax in Antp, and unaffected in lbe (Fig 5A–5D and 5F). In contrast, col mutants affected β-gal expression in both Tv1 and dAp neurons (Fig 5D–5F). Next, we mutated all conserved binding sites for Q50-Homeodomain proteins (TAAT; affecting both Antp and Lbe), Col and Exd (Fig 5M; Materials and Methods; S3 Data and S4 Data). We integrated these mutant transgenes into the same genomic location as the wild type transgenic construct and assayed the expression of β-gal expression in Tv1 and dAp neurons at stage 16. We found that all three mutated enhancers displayed reduced number of Tv1 and dAp cells expressing β-gal, when compared to the enhancer transgene in a wild type background (control) (Fig 5G–5L). We did not analyze the involvement of hth on the ap-CRM (or eya-CRM) because previous studies revealed that hth mutants could be fully rescued by re-expression of col [22]. exd mutants must be analyzed both as maternal and zygotic mutants, and we did not attempt to introduce the ap- and eya-CRM transgenes into such backgrounds.
28414802	FBgn0001089	GAL|Β-GAL	For analyzing the ap enhancer, we focused on the smaller apS2J-CRM-lacZ transgene, and placed this in the mutant background for Antp, lbe and col. Focusing on the Tv1 neurons, we observed significant reduction in β-gal expression in all three mutants (Antp, lbe and col), when compared to the enhancer transgene in a wild type background (control) stained on the same slide (Fig 5A–5E). As anticipated from the selective role of Antp, acting in the thorax, and lbe, in NB5-6T, the dAp neurons were only reduced in the thorax in Antp, and unaffected in lbe (Fig 5A–5D and 5F).

28414802	FBgn0267978	AP	Similar to the ap enhancer analysis, we placed the eya-CRM-GFP enhancer in the mutant background for Antp, lbe and col. Focusing on the Tv1 neurons, we observed significant reduction in GFP expression in all three mutants, when compared to the enhancer transgene in a wild type background (control) stained on the same slide (S4A–S4E Fig). As anticipated from the selective role of Antp, acting in the thorax, and lbe in NB5-6T, the dAp neurons were only reduced in the thorax in Antp, and unaffected in lbe (S4A–S4D and S4F Fig). In contrast, col mutants affected GFP expression in both Tv1 and dAp neurons (S4D–S4F Fig). Next, we mutated all conserved and non-conserved binding sites for Q50-Homeodomain proteins (TAAT; affecting both Antp and Lbe), Col and Exd (S4N Fig; Materials and Methods; S3 Data and S4 Data). We integrated these mutant transgenes into the same genomic location as the wild type transgenic construct and assayed the expression of GFP expression in Tv1 and dAp neurons at stage AFT. We found that the enhancers mutated for Hox and Col sites displayed reduced expression in both Tv1 and dAp cells, when compared to the enhancer transgene in a wild type background (control) (S4G–S4I, S4K and S4L Fig). In contrast, the mutation of Exd sites had no effect in Tv1 neurons, and surprisingly showed up-regulation in dAp neurons (S4J–S4L Fig).
28414802	FBgn0023091	DIMM	For analyzing the dimm enhancer, we placed the dimm-CRM-GFP transgene in the mutant backgrounds for Antp, ap, col and eya. We observed significant reduction of GFP expression in both Tv1 and dAp neurons in all four mutants, when compared to the enhancer transgene in a wild type background (control) stained on the same slide (S4A–S4G Fig). Next, we mutated all conserved and non-conserved binding sites for Q50-Homeodomain proteins (TAAT; affecting both Ap and Antp), Col and Exd (S5O Fig; Materials and Methods; S3 Data and S4 Data). We integrated these mutant transgenes into the same genomic location as the wild type transgenic construct and assayed the expression of GFP expression in Tv1 and dAp neurons at stage AFT. We found that enhancer mutants for Hox and Exd displayed reduced GFP expression in both Tv1 and dAp cells, when compared to the enhancer transgene in a wild type background (control) (S5H–S5N Fig). In contrast, the Col mutant enhancer showed slightly elevated expression in Tv1 neurons while expression was reduced in dAp neurons (S5J and S5L–S5N Fig).
28414802	FBgn0035092	NPLP1	For analyzing the Nplp1 enhancer, we placed the Nplp1-CRM-GFP transgene in the mutant backgrounds for col, ap, eya and dimm. We observed significant reduction of GFP expression in all four mutants, when compared to the enhancer transgene in a wild type background (control) stained on the same slide (Fig 6A–6G). Next, we mutated all possible conserved and non-conserved binding sites for Q50-Homeodomain proteins (TAAT; affecting Ap), Col and Dimm (E-boxes) (Fig 6P; Materials and Methods; S3 Data and S4 Data). We integrated these mutant transgenes into the same genomic location as the wild type transgenic construct and assayed the expression of GFP expression in Tv1 and dAp neurons at stage AFT. We observed that the enhancers mutated for Hox or Dimm sites displayed reduced GFP expression in both Tv1 and dAp cells, when compared to the enhancer transgene in a wild type background (control) (Fig 6H, 6I and 6K–6O). In contrast, the enhancer mutated for Col sites did not display any effect on GFP expression (Fig 6J, 6L and 6M).
28414802	FBgn0035092	NPLP1	Combining the findings presented in this study, we have been able to molecularly decode the Tv1/dAp genetic FFL cascades [6, 20, 21, 30], bolstering evidence for a complex molecular FFL, based upon sequential transcription factor binding to the downstream genes (Figs 8 and S6). The NB4-3 and NB5-6T neuroblasts are born in different regions of the VNC, and express different spatial determinants i.e., Antp, Lbe, Hth, Exd and Grn [20–22]. As lineage progression commences, they undergo a programmed cascade of transcription factor expression; the temporal cascade [9]. Early temporal factors Kr and Pdm integrate with Grn in NB4-3, while the late temporal factor Cas integrates with Antp, Lbe, Hth and Exd in NB5-6T, to create two distinct combinatorial spatio-temporal codes. These two codes converge on two different enhancers in the col gene, triggering Col expression, and hence the Nplp1 FFL. The FFL, in this case a so-called coherent FFL, where regulators act positively at one or several steps of a cascade, was first identified in E.coli and yeast regulatory networks [31], but have also been identified in C.elegans and Drosophila [6, 32, 33]. Coherent FFLs can act as regulatory timing devices, exemplified by the action of col in NB5-6T: The initial expression of col in Ap cluster cells triggers a generic Ap/Eya interneuron fate in all four cells, while its downregulation in Tv2-4 and maintenance in Tv1 helps propagate the FFL leading to Nplp1 expression [6, 20, 21, 30].
28414802	FBgn0267978	AP	The results on the eya, ap, dimm and Nplp1 enhancer mutants stand in stark contrast to the col CRMs findings. For these four genes, the enhancer deletion resulted in robust, near null effects, on expression. It is tempting to speculate that our findings, combined with previous studies, points to a different logic for early regulators, with highly dynamic patterns, requiring several functionally overlapping enhancers for fidelity, and late regulators and terminal differentiation genes, which may operate with one enhancer that is inactive until the pertinent combinatorial TF codes have been established.

28414802	FBgn0000320	EYA	Analysis of the ap and eya enhancers indicates that Col directly interacts with these enhancers. Both of these enhancer-reporter transgenes are affected in col mutants, and can be activated by ectopic col. Moreover, mutation of one Col binding site in the ap enhancer and two sites in the eya enhancer, was enough to dramatically reduce enhancer activity. Direct action of Col on ap and eya is furthermore supported by recent data on Col genome-wide binding, using ChIP, which demonstrated direct binding of Col to these regions of ap and eya in the embryo [34]. The regulation of ap is an excellent example of the complexity of gene regulation, and studies have identified additional enhancers controlling ap expression in the wing, muscle and brain [35–38].

28414802	FBgn0035092	NPLP1	In contrast to regulation of ap and eya, a direct action of Col on dimm and Nplp1 is less clear. Analysis of the dimm and Nplp1 enhancers did not reveal perfectly conserved Col binding sites. Mutation of multiple non-perfect Col binding sites in the dimm enhancer did not affect reporter expression in the Ap cluster, but did however reduce levels in the dorsal Ap cells. Mutation of non-perfect Col binding sites in the Nplp1 enhancer had no impact on enhancer activity, neither in Tv1 nor dAp. These findings support a model where Col is crucial for directly activating ap and eya, which in turn directly activate dimm and Nplp1, with some involvement of Col on dimm (Fig 8). However, support for a direct role for Col on Nplp1 comes from RNAi studies in larvae or adult flies, showing that knockdown of col resulted in loss of Nplp1, while Ap, Eya and Dimm expression was unaffected [6, 39].
28414802	FBgn0023091	DIMM	In contrast to regulation of ap and eya, a direct action of Col on dimm and Nplp1 is less clear. Analysis of the dimm and Nplp1 enhancers did not reveal perfectly conserved Col binding sites. Mutation of multiple non-perfect Col binding sites in the dimm enhancer did not affect reporter expression in the Ap cluster, but did however reduce levels in the dorsal Ap cells.

These findings support a model where Col is crucial for directly activating ap and eya, which in turn directly activate dimm and Nplp1, with some involvement of Col on dimm (Fig 8). However, support for a direct role for Col on Nplp1 comes from RNAi studies in larvae or adult flies, showing that knockdown of col resulted in loss of Nplp1, while Ap, Eya and Dimm expression was unaffected [6, 39].
28414802	FBgn0035092	NPLP1	It is tempting to speculate that Col regulates Nplp1 not via direct interaction with its enhancer, but rather as a chromatin state modulator, keeping the chromatin around the Nplp1 locus in an accessible state, in order for Dimm, Ap and Eya to be able to access the Nplp1 gene. Support for this notion comes from studies on the mammalian Col orthologue EBF, which is connected to the chromatin remodeling complex SWI/SNF during EBF-mediated gene regulation in lymphocytes [40]. Moreover, the central SWI/SNF component Brahma was recently identified in a genetic screen for Ap cluster neurons, and found to affect FMRFa neuropeptide expression in Tv4 without affecting Eya expression, indicating a late role in Ap cluster differentiation [41]. Alternatively, Col may activate Nplp1 via unidentified, low affinity sites, similar to the mechanism by which Ubx regulates some of its embryonic target genes [42].
28414802	FBgn0000320	EYA	Col activates the ap and eya genes. ap encodes a LIM-HD protein, a family of transcription factors well known to control multiple aspects of terminal neuronal subtype fate, including neurotransmitter identity, axon pathfinding and ion channel expression [17, 43–45]. Our results indicate that Ap in turn acts upon dimm, and subsequently with Dimm on Nplp1. eya encodes an evolutionary well-conserved phosphatase and does not bind DNA directly, instead acting as a transcriptional co-factor [46]. Eya (and its orthologues) have been found to interact with several transcription factors in different systems [46], but whether it forms complexes with Col and Ap is not known.
28414802	FBgn0035092	NPLP1	The final transcription factor in the FFL is Dimm, a bHLH protein. Dimm is selectively expressed by the majority of neuropeptide neurons in Drosophila, and is important for expression of many neuropeptides [6, 19, 29, 47, 48]. Intriguingly, Dimm is also both necessary and sufficient to establish the dense-core secretory machinery, found in neuropeptide neurons [29, 48–52]. Based upon these findings Dimm has been viewed as a cell type selector gene [1] or a “scaling factor” [53], acting to up-regulate the secretory machinery. Here, we find evidence for that Dimm acts directly on the Nplp1 enhancer, and this raises the possibility that Dimm is both a selector gene for the dense-core secretory machinery, and can act in some neuropeptide neurons to directly regulate specific neuropeptide gene expression.
