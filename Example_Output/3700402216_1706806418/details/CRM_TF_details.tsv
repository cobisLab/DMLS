28520736	FBgn0002973	NUMB	Stem cells are functional units in the development, maintenance, and regeneration of tissues in multicellular organisms. Defects in stem cell regulation can compromise tissue homeostasis and result in proliferative or degenerative diseases. Our understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms regulating the in vivo behavior of stem cells is still incomplete. The Drosophila central nervous system neural stem cells called neuroblasts have offered an excellent model system for uncovering key mechanisms and player involved in stem cell regulation. Previous genetic studies have uncovered the evolutionarily conserved Numb-N signaling pathway that regulates the self-renewal vs. differentiation choices of the cell fates of NSCs during their asymmetric division. Our understanding of how Numb-N signaling regulates NSC fate is still rudimentary. Recent studies have implicated the involvement of microRNAs in stem cell regulation in both mammalian and Drosophila systems. But the molecular mechanism and logic of miRNA action remain to be delineated. In this study we show that the bantam microRNA is a direct transcriptional target of the N signaling pathway, and that bantam feedback regulates N by negatively regulating the expression of Numb, an inhibitor of N. This feedback regulation of N helps maintain the robustness of NSC fate. We further show that bantam also impinges on a Numb-Myc axis of cell growth regulation, apparently in a N-independent manner. Together, our results highlight the importance of both transcriptional and translational control mechanisms in NSC regulation by the N signaling network. These findings have important implication for our understanding of the basic biology of NSCs and the therapeutic intervention of N-induced cancers.

28520736	FBgn0039016	DCR-1|DICER-1	To identify new players in the N signaling network important for NSC and CSC-like growth, we tested the microRNA pathway. In the fly larval central brain, N signaling is normally required for the maintenance of type II but not type I NBs, and N hyperactivation results in the formation of CSC-like NB within the type II but not type I NB lineages [6–8]. We used clonal overexpression (OE) of N intracellular domain (N-intra), an activated form of N, to induce ectopic formation and overproliferation of type II NBs and ensuing tumorous brain growth (Fig 1A and 1B). Inactivation of Dicer-1 (Dcr-1), a key component of the miRNA pathway [16], effectively rescued N-intra induced ectopic NB formation and tumorous growth, supporting a critical role for miRNA in N-regulated NSC lineage homeostasis (Fig 1A and 1B). Given the role of ban miRNA in controlling tissue growth, cell proliferation, and survival [17, 18], we tested its involvement in NSC regulation by N. Loss of ban function as in banΔ1 null mutant had similar effect as dcr-1 mutation in rescuing N-intra induced ectopic NB formation (Fig 1A and 1B), implicating ban as a key miRNA influencing NB homeostasis. To further confirm these results, we used a transgene overexpressing ban-sponge (ban-sp), which could effectively interfere with ban function [19]. CSC-like ectopic NB proliferation induced by OE of N [7, 9] was partially blocked by ban-sp (Fig 1C and 1D). Conversely, ban OE enhanced the N OE effect (S1 Fig). Overexpression of Dpn, a putative effector of the N pathway in NBs, caused the formation of CSC-like NB within the type II but not type I NB lineages [20, 21]. NB overproliferation caused by Dpn-OE was also attenuated by ban-sp (Fig 1E and 1F). Intriguingly, in banΔ1 mutant type II NB clones without N OE, the parental NBs were preserved (Figs 2A and S2E), suggesting that ban is not essential for NB formation or maintenance under normal condition. The number of IPs, however, is reduced in banΔ1 mutant type II NB clones (S2F Fig). These results are consistent with a recent report [18], which showed that both type I and type II NBs are reduced in ban mutant brains. However, in clonal analysis, each ban mutant clone still contains a NB with appropriate marker expression, albeit with reduced cell size [18]. These results suggest that ban may act cell autonomously to regulate NB cell size, but its effect on NB number may be mediated by a non-autonomous mechanism. Together, these results suggest that ban is preferentially required for the formation and proliferation of CSC-like cells induced by N pathway hyperactivation.
28520736	FBgn0002973	NUMB	We further examined the biochemical relationship between Numb and Myc underlying their functional interaction in ban-regulated nucleolar growth. In mammalian HEK293 cells, Numb and c-Myc exhibited physical interaction (Fig 4C). Overexpression of Numb led to reduced level of endogenous cMyc (Fig 4D and 4E), an effect abolished by treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (Fig 4F and 4G), suggesting that Numb affects Myc protein level through the ubiquitin-proteosome system (UPS). We have also examined Myc levels in Drosophila larval brain NBs with altered Numb activities. We found that dMyc level is increased when Numb is inhibited by RNAi, and decreased when Numb is overexpressed. This is true for both endogenous dMyc (S7A) or overexpressed dMyc (S7B). We have also tried to examine the effect of altered ban activities on dMyc expression. The immunostaining did not reveal consistent clear-cut results as seen in Numb manipulation case, probably because ban acts through Numb to indirectly affect dMyc expression, making its effect on dMyc protein level not as robust as Numb. However, when we examined the effect of altered ban activity on endogenous dMyc expression by western blot analysis of brain extracts, we saw increased dMyc protein level in ban GOF condition and reduced dMyc level in ban LOF condition (S7C Fig).
28520736	FBgn0262656	DMYC|C-MYC|CMYC	We further examined the biochemical relationship between Numb and Myc underlying their functional interaction in ban-regulated nucleolar growth.

28520736	FBgn0002973	NUMB	Previous studies showed that OE of a phospho-mimetic form of Numb (Numb-TS4D) caused ectopic NB formation and tumorous brain growth, an effect likely reflecting a dominant-negative effect of Numb-TS4D in inhibiting endogenous Numb, as co-expression of Numb-WT completely rescued the Numb-TS4D effect [27]. We found that the Numb-TS4D effect was also rescued by ban-sp (Fig 4H and 4I), presumably due to elevation of the level of endogenous Numb by ban-sp that counteracted Numb-TS4D action. In contrast, co-overexpression of ban using UAS-ban-D did not change Numb-TS4D effect (Fig 4H and 4I), presumably because endogenous Numb activity has been sufficiently inhibited by Numb-TS4D such that its further translational repression by ban-D OE will not have additional phenotypic effect.
24945799	FBgn0086680	VVL|VENTRAL VEINS LACKING	Specialized endocrine cells produce and release steroid hormones that govern development, metabolism and reproduction. In order to synthesize steroids, all the genes in the biosynthetic pathway must be coordinately turned on in steroidogenic cells. In Drosophila, the steroid producing endocrine cells are located in the prothoracic gland (PG) that releases the steroid hormone ecdysone. The transcriptional regulatory network that specifies the unique PG specific expression pattern of the ecdysone biosynthetic genes remains unknown. Here, we show that two transcription factors, the POU-domain Ventral veins lacking (Vvl) and the nuclear receptor Knirps (Kni), have essential roles in the PG during larval development. Vvl is highly expressed in the PG during embryogenesis and is enriched in the gland during larval development, suggesting that Vvl might function as a master transcriptional regulator in this tissue. Vvl and Kni bind to PG specific cis-regulatory elements that are required for expression of the ecdysone biosynthetic genes. Knock down of either vvl or kni in the PG results in a larval developmental arrest due to failure in ecdysone production. Furthermore, Vvl and Kni are also required for maintenance of TOR/S6K and prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH) signaling in the PG, two major pathways that control ecdysone biosynthesis and PG cell growth. We also show that the transcriptional regulator, Molting defective (Mld), controls early biosynthetic pathway steps. Our data show that Vvl and Kni directly regulate ecdysone biosynthesis by transcriptional control of biosynthetic gene expression and indirectly by affecting PTTH and TOR/S6K signaling. This provides new insight into the regulatory network of transcription factors involved in the coordinated regulation of steroidogenic cell specific transcription, and identifies a new function of Vvl and Knirps in endocrine cells during post-embryonic development.

24945799	FBgn0086680	VVL|VENTRAL VEINS LACKING	Steroid hormones play important roles in physiology and disease. These hormones are molecules produced and secreted by endocrine cells in the body and control sexual maturation, metabolism and reproduction. We found transcriptional regulators that underlie the specialized function of endocrine steroid-producing cells. In the steroid-producing cells of the fruit fly Drosophila, Ventral veins lacking (Vvl) and Knirps (Kni) turn on all the genes required for steroid production. When Vvl or Kni were inactivated in the cells where the hormone is made, the genes involved in steroid production were not activated. Because of the reduced steroid production, the juvenile larvae failed to develop and undergo maturation to adulthood. Inactivation of Vvl and Kni also reduces endocrine cell growth by disturbing their response to growth promoting signals. Genetic variations in humans with the loss of a homolog of Vvl have been associated with disorders caused by insufficient steroid production. Together with the fact that Vvl is highly expressed in the steroid-producing cells of Drosophila, this suggests that Vvl may be a conserved master regulator of steroid production. Our findings provide insight into the network of factors that control endocrine cell function and steroid hormone levels that could have implication for human diseases.

24945799	FBgn0004959	PHANTOM	Despite the importance of the coordinated expression in endocrine cells of the steroidogenic enzymes, the PG specific transcriptional regulatory networks that underlie steroidogenic cell function remain unknown. The steroidogenic function of the PG cells is defined by the restricted expression of the genes involved in ecdysone biosynthesis that mediate the conversion of cholesterol to ecdysone. The components of the ecdysone biosynthetic pathway include the Rieske-domain protein Neverland (Nvd) [4], [5], the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase Shroud (Sro) [6] and the P450 enzymes Spook (Spo), Spookier (Spok), Phantom (Phm), Disembodied (Dib) and Shadow (Sad) [7]–[12] collectively referred to as the Halloween genes. Ecdysone produced by the PG is released into circulation and converted into the more active hormone, 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E), in peripheral tissues by the P450 enzyme, Shade (Shd) [13], [14].

This is likely orchestrated by multiple transcription factors working in a network to achieve spatial and temporal control of steroid hormone production during development. The composition of this tissue-specific transcriptional regulation remains largely elusive, although some transcription factors are known to regulate ecdysone production in the PG [15]-[18]. The nuclear receptor DHR4 functions as a repressor of ecdysone biosynthesis in the PG and responds to prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH) mediated activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway [17]. Loss of βFTZ-F1 in the PG has also been associated with reduced expression of phm and dib

The zing-finger protein Without children (Woc) is required for ecdysone biosynthesis [19], although the pathway component regulated by Woc has not been identified. However, it is unclear if Woc, βFTZ-F1 and DHR4 bind directly to the regulatory regions that control expression of the ecdysone biosynthetic genes. In contrast, we recently showed that the transcription factor Broad (Br) regulates expression of the genes involved in ecdysone biosynthesis by direct binding to their promoters/enhancers [20]. Although these factors may be important for steroidogenic gene expression, other factors are likely required for the transcriptional regulatory network that defines the PG cell-specific expression of the ecdysone biosynthetic pathway components.

24945799	FBgn0086680	VVL|VENTRAL VEINS LACKING	Here, we report a novel role for Ventral veins lacking (Vvl) and Knirps (Kni) in regulating ecdysteroidogenesis in Drosophila. The cis-regulatory elements responsible for PG specific expression of spok, phm and dib contain conserved Vvl and Kni binding sites. Expression of vvl is high in the PG compared to the whole animal, while kni expression is less PG-specific. Knock down of vvl and kni in the PG results in larval developmental arrest due to impaired ecdysone production. We show that Vvl and Kni specifically regulate expression of all the ecdysone biosynthetic enzymes through functionally important regulatory sites. Furthermore, we find that Molting defective (Mld) specifically regulates enzymes that catalyze early steps in the ecdysone biosynthetic pathway. Our study identifies Vvl as a PG cell-specific transcription factor that underlies steroidogenic cell function. We conclude that Vvl and Kni are involved in the transcriptional regulatory network of the PG that coordinates expression of biosynthetic enzymes required for ecdysone production during Drosophila development.

24945799	FBgn0086680	VVL	We analyzed the phm and dib PG specific regulatory elements for transcription factor binding sites. Our in silico search revealed conserved binding sites for the POU-domain transcription factor Vvl and the nuclear receptor Kni in the phm promoter and dib enhancer (Fig. 1A and S1). Analysis of the phm promoter identified one conserved Vvl site and four Kni sites of which three are highly conserved, indicating that they are important regulatory sites. In support of this, mutations disrupting the Vvl site and one of the conserved Kni sites eliminate PG specific GFP reporter expression [20]. In contrast, mutations in the non-conserved Kni binding sites do not reduce PG expression. The third intron dib enhancer also contains one Vvl site and two Kni sites, both in regions that have been conserved. We also identified a 300 bp PG specific promoter for spok, encoding an enzyme that acts at an early step in the ecdysone biosynthetic pathway [9]. This element located −331 to −32 bp upstream of translation start drives specific PG reporter GFP expression. This spok promoter contains three Vvl and three Kni binding sites, although these sites are less conserved compared to the Vvl and Kni sites identified in the phm and dib regulatory elements. Expression of spok has previously been reported to require Molting defective (Mld), a nuclear zinc finger protein [9]. Since the DNA binding sequence motif for Mld has not yet been characterized, we were unable to examine potential Mld binding sites in the spok promoter.

The third intron dib enhancer also contains one Vvl site and two Kni sites, both in regions that have been conserved. We also identified a 300 bp PG specific promoter for spok, encoding an enzyme that acts at an early step in the ecdysone biosynthetic pathway [9]. This element located −331 to −32 bp upstream of translation start drives specific PG reporter GFP expression. This spok promoter contains three Vvl and three Kni binding sites, although these sites are less conserved compared to the Vvl and Kni sites identified in the phm and dib regulatory elements. Expression of spok has previously been reported to require Molting defective (Mld), a nuclear zinc finger protein [9]. Since the DNA binding sequence motif for Mld has not yet been characterized, we were unable to examine potential Mld binding sites in the spok promoter.

We performed in situ hybridization on third instar larvae and observed an intense staining of vvl mRNA in the PG (Fig. 1B). Moreover, strong embryonic vvl expression is seen in the primordium of the PG from stage 13. Importantly, the appearance of vvl in the PG precedes that of the biosynthetic genes which are expressed by stage 15 in the PG primordium [11], [12]. Although in situ expression of kni was undetectable in the PG of embryos, expression in the PG was observed at the L3 stage (Fig 1B). We also detected expression of vvl in nurse and follicle cells of adult female ovaries (Fig. S1).

Although kni expression was not detected using in situ hybridization in the embryonic PG, expression of Kni was found in the PG at the L2 stage (Fig. S1). Next, we quantified vvl and kni expression in the ring gland (an organ with by far the most of its volume constituted by PG cells) compared to the whole body in order to see if these transcription factors are enriched in the PG (Fig. 1D). As a control, we measured phm expression, which indeed is highly expressed in the PG compared to the whole animal and mld, encoding a factor with a specific role in the PG, but with a broader expression pattern (Fig. 1D and S1) [12], [21]. Expression of vvl was highly enriched in the ring gland, like phm, while kni expression was less specific to this tissue similar to mld.

24945799	FBgn0086680	VVL	Based on the potential regulatory role of Vvl and Kni, we next sought to determine if these transcription factors are required for PG expression of the genes involved in ecdysone biosynthesis. We used the PG specific phm-Gal4 (phm>) driver and observed that knock down of vvl in the PG using UAS-vvl-RNAi (vvl-RNAi) resulted in first instar (L1) arrest (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, RNAi mediated knock down of kni in the PG, by using phm> with a UAS-kni-RNAi (kni-RNAi), led to an L1 and second instar (L2) arrest phenotype. To exclude the contribution of off-target effects, we tested PG specific knock down of vvl and kni using other transgenic RNAi lines that target different regions of the vvl and kni mRNA and found that they produce similar phenotypes (Table S1). To support this, we also used the P0206-Gal4 (P0206>) driver that promotes weak expression in the PG cells [22]. When expression of vvl and kni was reduced using P0206>, development was arrested during later stages compared to when crossed with phm>. Knock down of mld in the PG with phm> driven UAS-mld-RNAi (mld-RNAi) also resulted in L1 arrest (Fig. 2A) consistent with mutant analysis [9], [21].

24945799	FBgn0086680	VVL	We next investigated if Vvl and Kni regulate the expression of the genes involved in ecdysone biosynthesis. phm>vvl-RNAi and phm>kni-RNAi larvae showed reduction in the expression of phm, dib and sad by the mid-first instar 36 hours AEL compared to the control (Fig. 3A). Knock down of vvl also reduced expression of sro and spok, encoding enzymes believed to work in early steps in the pathway known as the black box [4], [5], [9]. However, expression of nvd, encoding a PG specific gene involved in the first step in the biosynthetic pathway, was not significantly reduced in the mid-first instar by knock down of vvl or kni in the PG. This further supports the notion that the PG is specified normally during embryogenesis. Previous studies have indicated that mld mutants have reduced ecdysone levels because of a specific lack of spok expression [9], [21]. Our knock down results involving mld-RNAi in the PG support that Mld is required specifically for the expression of spok, but not for the later acting products of phm, dib and sad.

24945799	FBgn0086680	VVL	The binding sites of these factors in the PG specific regulatory elements indicate that Vvl and Kni are involved in a transcriptional network necessary for co-expression of the biosynthetic enzymes. We therefore sought to establish if Vvl and Kni can bind directly to the PG specific regulatory elements by performing a DNA/protein binding assay. For this purpose, we performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) with the conserved sites in the phm promoter since the functional importance of these sites has been confirmed [20]. Radiolabeled DNA oligonucleotide sequences that contained the conserved vvl or kni binding sites in the phm promoter required for PG expression (Fig. 1A) formed DNA/protein complexes with nuclear cell extract (Fig. 3B and C). These complexes were outcompeted by unlabeled oligonucleotide sequences containing consensus vvl or kni sites and by the unlabeled phm oligonucleotides containing the vvl or kni site, but not by the unlabeled phm oligonucleotides with mutated vvl or kni binding sites or by an unspecific oligonucleotide sequence. This finding demonstrates that the vvl and kni sites are required for formation of the DNA/protein complex and supports that Vvl and Kni regulate transcription of the genes involved in ecdysone biosynthesis by direct binding to their promoters and enhancers.

24945799	FBgn0086680	VVL	The data indicate that Vvl and Kni are critical for the steroidogenic activity of the PG during early post-embryonic development. Later during larval development the up-regulation of ecdysone biosynthetic genes and the growth of the gland are required to produce the high-level ecdysone pulse that triggers metamorphosis. To investigate the role of Vvl and Kni during later stages of postembryonic development, we analyzed their expression in third instar (L3) larval ring glands from early (72 hours AEL), mid (96 hours AEL) and late (120 hours AEL) L3 larvae. In wild type larvae, expression of the steroidogenic genes showed no or little increase from the early to mid L3, but a dramatic up-regulation in the late L3 (Fig. 4A), coinciding with the high-level ecdysone peak that triggers pupariation 120 hours AEL [20]. While the expression of vvl showed only a minor increase during the L3 stage, a stronger up-regulation of kni and mld was observed. Compared to both vvl, kni and mld, expression of Br-Z4 was highly up-regulated in the late L3 consistent with its role in the temporal up-regulation of the biosynthetic genes important for the high-level ecdysone pulse 120 hours AEL that triggers pupariation [24]. Considering the tissue-specificity and that vvl expression in the PG shows little relation with the ecdysone titer, it seems likely that Vvl is important for the spatial control of ecdysone biosynthetic gene expression in the PG, but not for the temporal regulation during development. On the other hand, kni expression is less PG specific, but show more correlation with the ecdysone titer during L3.
24945799	FBgn0086680	VVL	To determine whether Vvl and Kni are only required to set the initial expression of the biosynthetic enzymes during embryonic and early larval development or also to maintain PG expression during late larval stages, we used tub-Gal80ts;phm-Gal4 (Gal80ts;phm>) to conditionally induce the UAS-RNAi effect. Gal80ts;phm>vvl-RNAi and Gal80ts;phm>kni-RNAi larvae develop normally at 18°C and were shifted to 29°C to induce the RNAi at different times during larval stages. Development of most Gal80ts;phm>vvl-RNAi, Gal80ts;phm>kni-RNAi and Gal80ts;phm>mld-RNAi larvae was arrested in L3 when larvae were shifted to 29°C 120 hours AEL or earlier, while larvae that were shifted 144 hours AEL or later pupariated normally (Fig. S2). Because development is slowed down at 18°C, 120 hours AEL is corresponding to the late L2 stage under these conditions [25]. Thus, inducing RNAi in late L2 or earlier causes developmental arrest in L3, suggesting that it prevents the production of the high-level ecdysone pulse in late L3 that triggers metamorphosis.

24945799	FBgn0086680	VVL	Since expression of the biosynthetic genes detected in L1 larvae with reduced expression of vvl and kni was measured on RNA extracted from whole animals (Fig. 3A), and normalized to Rpl23 and Rpl32, ubiquitously expressed ribosomal housekeeping genes, it is possible that reduced PG cell growth could be responsible for the observed decrease in biosynthetic gene expression because of a reduced PG to whole animal size ratio. To exclude this possibility and to test whether Vvl and Kni are required to maintain PG specific expression of steroidogenic genes later during development, we analyzed expression in isolated ring glands from L3 larvae. We first confirmed the efficient reduction of vvl and kni mRNA levels compared to the control (Fig. S2). Additional analysis showed that expression of all of the steroidogenic enzymes was dramatically decreased in L3 ring glands in which vvl and kni were knocked down compared to the control (Fig. 4B). This demonstrates that the decreased expression of the ecdysone biosynthetic genes in vvl-RNAi and kni-RNAi animals is a consequence of a specific reduction in the transcription of steroidogenic genes, and not reduced glandular growth or a general reduction in transcription. Compared to vvl-RNAi and kni-RNAi, mld knock down had little or no influence on the transcription of the genes encoding enzymes acting in late steps in the biosynthetic pathway. However, spok and nvd levels were strongly reduced in the ring glands of mld-RNAi larvae compared to the control, suggesting that these are direct targets of mld regulation. This indicates that Mld is involved in the transcriptional regulation of the enzymes mediating early biosynthetic conversions of cholesterol. The observation that mld-RNAi also regulates nvd expression may explain why spok overexpression in the PG is insufficient to rescue mld mutants [9].

24945799	FBgn0086680	VVL	Our data demonstrate that Vvl and Kni are specifically involved in transcriptional regulation of ecdysone biosynthetic components. However, when we analyzed the morphology of PG cells with reduced expression of vvl and kni, we found a mild decrease in PG cell size (Fig. 6A and B), indicating that knock down of these transcription factors also influence cellular growth. The major pathways that are thought to control PG cell growth are the PTTH and the insulin/TOR pathways [22], [28]–[32]. Therefore, we investigated the possibility that Vvl and Kni affect PG cell growth and ecdysone synthesis indirectly by interfering with PTTH and/or insulin/TOR signaling. The neuropeptide, PTTH promotes PG growth and ecdysone synthesis through activation of its receptor Torso, a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) expressed specifically in the PG [33]. Activation of the insulin receptor (InR), another RTK, in the PG also regulates cell growth and stimulates ecdysone synthesis in response to circulating insulin levels. Although crosstalk between systemic insulin mediated growth regulation and TOR signaling might occur, the TOR pathway cell-autonomously regulates growth in response to cellular nutrient levels [34]. We therefore investigated whether PTTH and insulin/TOR signaling in the gland is affected by knock down of vvl and kni. Analysis of torso transcript levels revealed that, while mld-RNAi larvae have normal torso mRNA levels, expression of the PTTH receptor is reduced in ring glands from L3 vvl-RNAi and kni-RNAi larvae (Fig. 6C). Consistent with down-regulation of the PTTH receptor, we found reduced levels of phosphorylated ERK, an indicator of MAPK activity and PTTH signaling [33], in BRGCs from vvl-RNAi and kni-RNAi larvae (Fig. S4). However, unlike the biosynthetic enzymes (Fig. 3), expression of torso was not reduced in L1 phm>vvl-RNAi larvae 36 hours AEL (Fig. S4), indicating that torso expression is initiated normally despite the loss of vvl in the PG. When examining the expression of the InR and components mediating insulin signaling, we found reduced expression in vvl-RNAi and kni-RNAi animals of 4EBP that encodes a negative growth regulator depressed by activation of the insulin pathway. Further, levels of akt, which encodes a serine/threonine kinase of the insulin signaling pathway [35], were increased, while levels of InR were decreased in vvl-RNAi larvae. Increased insulin signaling is generally associated with decreased expression of both 4EBP and InR[36], [37]. These results imply that loss of vvl and kni increases insulin signaling. The most likely explanation for increased insulin signaling in PG of animals with reduced vvl and kni expression is the low ecdysone levels, which cause a general increase of insulin release from the brain [29]. Thus, the disturbance of insulin signaling in the PG of vvl-RNAi and kni-RNAi animals seems unlikely to account for the PG cell growth reduction. However, we observed a strong transcriptional reduction of the S6 kinase (S6K), an important positive growth regulator downstream of TOR. This suggests that the combined reduction of both PTTH/Torso and TOR/S6K signaling in the PG contributes to the negative influence of vvl-RNAi and kni-RNAi on PG cell growth and ecdysone synthesis. Why does mld knock down not affect PG cell size negatively (Fig. 6A and B)? Since loss of mld does not affect torso expression (Fig. 6C), it is possible that disturbance of the TOR/S6K pathway alone is insufficient to impair growth, especially if this is combined with increased insulin signaling as indicated by the decreased InR and 4EBP mRNA levels in the ring glands of mld-RNAi larvae.

Why does mld knock down not affect PG cell size negatively (Fig. 6A and B)? Since loss of mld does not affect torso expression (Fig. 6C), it is possible that disturbance of the TOR/S6K pathway alone is insufficient to impair growth, especially if this is combined with increased insulin signaling as indicated by the decreased InR and 4EBP mRNA levels in the ring glands of mld-RNAi larvae.
24945799	FBgn0013323	PTTH	Our data demonstrate that Vvl and Kni are specifically involved in transcriptional regulation of ecdysone biosynthetic components. However, when we analyzed the morphology of PG cells with reduced expression of vvl and kni, we found a mild decrease in PG cell size (Fig. 6A and B), indicating that knock down of these transcription factors also influence cellular growth. The major pathways that are thought to control PG cell growth are the PTTH and the insulin/TOR pathways [22], [28]–[32]. Therefore, we investigated the possibility that Vvl and Kni affect PG cell growth and ecdysone synthesis indirectly by interfering with PTTH and/or insulin/TOR signaling. The neuropeptide, PTTH promotes PG growth and ecdysone synthesis through activation of its receptor Torso, a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) expressed specifically in the PG [33]. Activation of the insulin receptor (InR), another RTK, in the PG also regulates cell growth and stimulates ecdysone synthesis in response to circulating insulin levels. Although crosstalk between systemic insulin mediated growth regulation and TOR signaling might occur, the TOR pathway cell-autonomously regulates growth in response to cellular nutrient levels [34]. We therefore investigated whether PTTH and insulin/TOR signaling in the gland is affected by knock down of vvl and kni. Analysis of torso transcript levels revealed that, while mld-RNAi larvae have normal torso mRNA levels, expression of the PTTH receptor is reduced in ring glands from L3 vvl-RNAi and kni-RNAi larvae (Fig. 6C). Consistent with down-regulation of the PTTH receptor, we found reduced levels of phosphorylated ERK, an indicator of MAPK activity and PTTH signaling [33], in BRGCs from vvl-RNAi and kni-RNAi larvae (Fig. S4). However, unlike the biosynthetic enzymes (Fig. 3), expression of torso was not reduced in L1 phm>vvl-RNAi larvae 36 hours AEL (Fig. S4), indicating that torso expression is initiated normally despite the loss of vvl in the PG. When examining the expression of the InR and components mediating insulin signaling, we found reduced expression in vvl-RNAi and kni-RNAi animals of 4EBP that encodes a negative growth regulator depressed by activation of the insulin pathway. Further, levels of akt, which encodes a serine/threonine kinase of the insulin signaling pathway [35], were increased, while levels of InR were decreased in vvl-RNAi larvae. Increased insulin signaling is generally associated with decreased expression of both 4EBP and InR[36], [37]. These results imply that loss of vvl and kni increases insulin signaling. The most likely explanation for increased insulin signaling in PG of animals with reduced vvl and kni expression is the low ecdysone levels, which cause a general increase of insulin release from the brain [29]. Thus, the disturbance of insulin signaling in the PG of vvl-RNAi and kni-RNAi animals seems unlikely to account for the PG cell growth reduction. However, we observed a strong transcriptional reduction of the S6 kinase (S6K), an important positive growth regulator downstream of TOR. This suggests that the combined reduction of both PTTH/Torso and TOR/S6K signaling in the PG contributes to the negative influence of vvl-RNAi and kni-RNAi on PG cell growth and ecdysone synthesis. Why does mld knock down not affect PG cell size negatively (Fig. 6A and B)? Since loss of mld does not affect torso expression (Fig. 6C), it is possible that disturbance of the TOR/S6K pathway alone is insufficient to impair growth, especially if this is combined with increased insulin signaling as indicated by the decreased InR and 4EBP mRNA levels in the ring glands of mld-RNAi larvae.
24945799	FBgn0086680	VVL	Drosophila developmental progression is dictated by tightly regulated ecdysone pulses released from the PG. Like any cell specialized for steroid biosynthesis, the PG expresses a set of enzymes that mediate steps in the conversion of cholesterol into steroids. The tissue-specific expression of these enzymes is key to the specialization of the cells that endows the PG with the competence to produce ecdysone. The transcriptional control mechanism underlying such regulation is likely orchestrated by a regulatory network of transcription factors. Here, we identify two transcription factors Vvl and Kni that are required for the expression of the biosynthetic enzymes in the ecdysone producing PG cells. Vvl is a POU domain transcription factor which has multiple important functions during Drosophila development. Mutations in vvl cause embryonic lethality with defects in the development of the trachea and the nervous system [38]–[41]. Moreover, Vvl is required for wing vein development and is involved in innate immunity by regulation of the expression of antimicrobial peptides [42], [43]. We show that Vvl is expressed in the PG during late embryogenesis and in the larval stages. One important characteristic of Vvl is that it maintains its own expression by autoregulation [44]. Once activated, Vvl maintains its expression and likely also the expression of the ecdysone biosynthetic genes in the PG. Knock down of vvl in the PG reduces the expression of all genes in the biosynthetic pathway, showing that Vvl is required for maintaining expression of all pathway components. Together with the high expression of Vvl in the gland, this suggests that Vvl is a master transcriptional regulator involved in specifying the genetic program that dictates PG cell identity including its tissue-specific expression of steroidogenic enzymes. It is interesting to note that human chromosome 6 deletions that affect POU3F2, a homolog of Vvl, have been associated with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and adrenal insufficiency [45], [46], making it possible that Vvl is a conserved regulator of steroid biosynthesis.

24945799	FBgn0086680	VVL	Although Vvl and Kni specifically control genes in the steroidogenic pathway, other targets of these factors could also be important for ecdysone synthesis in the PG. During development the continuous growth of the PG cells and endoreplication of DNA is important to scale its hormone production to the capacity required for developmental progression. We found that both vvl-RNAi and kni-RNAi larvae have mildly reduced PG nuclei and cell size, which is likely to contribute to the reduced ecdysone levels in these animals. Kni has been shown to suppress endoreplication activity in the gut by regulating cell cycle genes [48]. This is in contrast to our observation indicating that loss of kni results in a reduction in the nuclei size, and hence, reduced polyploidy of the PG cells. Instead our results indicate that loss of vvl and kni reduces activity of PTTH/Torso and TOR/S6K signaling, two major pathways that promote growth and stimulate ecdysone biosynthesis [30], [31], [33], [57]. However, loss of vvl and kni had no effect on torso expression in the mid-first instar. This indicates that these factors are not required for the initial setting of torso expression, but for the maintenance of high torso expression during development. In tracheal cells, Vvl is required to maintain expression of the RTK breathless, but not for activating its initial expression [42], [58]. It is unclear how the transcription of the biosynthetic enzymes fluctuates during the low level ecdysone peaks in L1 and L2, before the induction of the steroidogenic pathway by PTTH stimulation [17]. Unlike PTTH/Torso, Vvl and Kni are required in the PG during L1 and L2 for the transition to the L3 stage, which suggests that Vvl and Kni are important for the proper transcription of the biosynthetic enzymes throughout larval development. Altogether, these data suggest that in addition to being required to initiate and maintain expression of the biosynthetic enzymes, Vvl and Kni play an indirect role important for ecdysone production by enabling PG cells to be competent to respond to PTTH and by regulating the TOR/S6K pathway. In contrast, Vvl and Kni are not required for normal expression of EcR in the gland, indicating that feedback regulation of ecdysone biosynthesis is not influenced by knock down of these factors [20]. In contrast to the transcription factor Br-Z4 involved in positive feedback regulation, which is strongly induced in the PG during late L3 to up-regulate expression of the biosynthetic pathway components, PG expression of vvl shows little relation with the high-level ecdysone peak that triggers pupariation. Taken together these data suggest that Vvl is required for maintaining PG specific expression (i.e. spatial control), while temporal regulation during development is controlled by other factors such as Br-Z4. Furthermore, our results confirm that Mld is required for PG expression of spok

24945799	FBgn0086680	VVL	Our data show that Vvl and Kni are required in the PG during post-embryonic development to maintain PG specific expression of the ecdysone biosynthetic genes. During embryogenesis, vvl expression appears in the PG primordium by stage 13, after the embryonic ecdysone pulse (stage 8–12 [12]) that is required for morphogenesis and differentiation of the embryo. During early embryonic development where the PG primordium is not yet formed, the spatial expression patterns of kni and vvl (Fig. 1B) are different from the biosynthetic genes essential for the embryonic ecdysone pulse [8], [9], [11], [12], [59]. This suggests that Vvl and Kni regulate the biosynthetic genes in the PG, but not during early embryonic development. Consistent with this notion, vvl and kni mutants differentiate the embryonic cuticle [42], [60], unlike the ecdysone deficient mutants that are unable to produce the embryonic ecdysone peak [11], [59]. In adult females, the ovaries are believed to be the source of ecdysone consistent with expression of the ecdysone biosynthetic genes in the nurse and/or follicle cells [11]–[13]. In adult females, we find that vvl is expressed in both nurse and follicle cells, suggesting that Vvl may be involved in regulating expression of the ecdysone biosynthetic genes in the adult stage.

24945799	FBgn0086680	VVL	Interestingly, we observed that loss of vvl, kni or mld results in dramatic increase of npc1a expression in the PG. Npc1a is highly expressed in the PG where it is required for uptake and intracellular trafficking of cholesterol for steroidogeneis [26]. Larvae with loss of npc1a exhibit a punctuate pattern of sterol accumulation in the PG cells, indicating defects in cholesterol transport within the cells. Normally cholesterol is taken up as low density lipoproteins (LDLs) and trafficked within endosomes to the lysosomes where hydrolysis releases free cholesterol that is delivered to the plasma membrane and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) [61] where the first step in the conversion of cholesterol to ecdysone likely takes place. Why is npc1a up-regulated in the PG when ecdysone synthesis and pathway activity is impaired? It seems unlikely that Vvl, Kni and Mld are all involved in repression of npc1a. The block of flux through the biosynthetic pathway in the PG of vvl-RNAi, kni-RNAi and mld-RNAi animals may change intracellular cholesterol pools in the gland and affect feedback regulation to maintain cholesterol homeostasis. Our results indicate that npc1a is regulated by cholesterol suggesting that the up-regulation of npc1a may be part of a feedback regulatory response to changes in cellular cholesterol levels. This may indicate a compensatory mechanism to redistribute cholesterol by increasing storage of cholesterol esters and/or efflux to reduce free cholesterol levels when ecdysone biosynthesis is blocked. Moreover, npc1a is regulated by Br [27], a factor induced by EcR in the PG [20], implying that ncp1a may also be regulated by ecdysone feedback. Our study shows that cholesterol availability is an important parameter for ecdysone biosynthesis. Interactions between cholesterol and ecdysone feedback mechanisms may therefore be important for coordinating the supply cholesterol with the rate of steroidogenesis.

We have shown here that the transcription factors, Vvl and Kni, are required for the coordinated expression of ecdysone biosynthetic genes in the PG. The transcriptional activation by Vvl and Kni is likely mediated by direct binding to cis-regulatory elements responsible for PG specific expression. This identifies an important new role for Vvl and Kni during post-embryonic development in the gene regulatory network of the steroid hormone producing cells in Drosophila.

28414802	FBgn0004878	CASTOR	The nervous system contains a myriad of different neuronal sub-types, and understanding cell fate specification remains a major challenge. Studies in a number of systems have revealed that neuronal subtype specification relies upon complex cascades of regulatory information, involving spatial and temporal selector genes [1], onwards to terminal selector genes [2, 3], often acting in combinatorial codes [4–6]. With respect to spatial information, the Hox homeotic selector genes, expressed in distinct but partly overlapping domains along the antero-posterior axis of the central nervous system, have been extensively studied for their role in cell fate specification [reviewed in [7, 8]]. With regard to temporal information, seminal studies in the Drosophila embryonic central nervous system (CNS) has identified a temporal cascade, where the sequential expression of the transcription factors Hunchback (Hb), Kruppel (Kr), Pdm2 and Nubbin (collectively referred to as Pdm), Castor (Cas) and Grainy head (Grh) play out in most, if not all neuroblasts (NBs) [reviewed in [9]]. The temporal factors dictate the identity of neurons and glia being specified at different stages of NB lineage progression. Although not conserved in its entirety, research in mammals has pointed to similar temporal progressions, and begun identifying some of the factors involved [reviewed in [10]]. In addition, studies have revealed that the Hox spatial information can converge with temporal cues to thereby specify neuronal subtypes [11]. While these functional genetic studies have provided insight into the genetic mechanisms underlying neuronal subtype specification, it is largely unclear how the broader spatio-temporal cues are molecularly integrated to cause discrete terminal selector gene expression, and how terminal selectors feed forward to final cell identity.

This resulted in significant reduction of expression in all four cases, when compared to the enhancer transgene in a wild type background (control) stained on the same slide, with the strongest effect in cas mutants, which displayed a near-complete loss of expression (Fig 3A–3F). Next, we mutated conserved DNA-binding sequences for Antp, Cas, Hth and Exd within the col-Tv-CRM-lacZ, and integrated these into the same genomic location as the wild type transgenic construct (Fig 3M; Materials and Methods; S3 Data and S4 Data). We assayed β-gal expression in NB5-6T at St14, and found that all of the four mutated enhancer transgenes displayed reduced expression, when compared to the enhancer transgene in a wild type background (control) stained on the same slide (Fig 3G–3M).

This resulted in significant reduction of expression in all four cases, when compared to the enhancer transgene in a wild type background (control) stained on the same slide, with the strongest effect in cas mutants, which displayed a near-complete loss of expression (Fig 3A–3F). Next, we mutated conserved DNA-binding sequences for Antp, Cas, Hth and Exd within the col-Tv-CRM-lacZ, and integrated these into the same genomic location as the wild type transgenic construct (Fig 3M; Materials and Methods; S3 Data and S4 Data). We assayed β-gal expression in NB5-6T at St14, and found that all of the four mutated enhancer transgenes displayed reduced expression, when compared to the enhancer transgene in a wild type background (control) stained on the same slide (Fig 3G–3M).
28414802	FBgn0001138	GRN	Next we turned to the col-dAp-CRM-GFP enhancer and introduced it into the Kr, pdm and grn mutant backgrounds. We observed significant reduction in GFP expression in all three mutants, when compared to the enhancer transgene in a wild type background (control) stained on the same slide (Fig 4A–4E). The loss of GFP expression in the dAp cells, was accompanied by the loss of Eya expression. Next, we mutated all possible binding sites, conserved and non-conserved, for Kr, Pdm (POU-HD) and Grn (GATA) (Fig 4L; Materials and Methods; S3 Data and S4 Data). We integrated these mutant transgenes into the same genomic location as the wild type transgenic construct and assayed the expression of GFP expression in dAp neurons at stage AFT. We found that the enhancers mutated for Kr or Pdm displayed reduced number of dAp cells expressing GFP, when compared to the enhancer transgene in a wild type background (control) (Fig 4F–4H and 4J). The enhancer transgene mutated for Grn sites did not show a numerical loss of GFP expressing dAp cells, but did however show a significantly reduced level of expression in these cells (Fig 4I and 4K).
28414802	FBgn0000611	EXD	For analyzing the ap enhancer, we focused on the smaller apS2J-CRM-lacZ transgene, and placed this in the mutant background for Antp, lbe and col. Focusing on the Tv1 neurons, we observed significant reduction in β-gal expression in all three mutants (Antp, lbe and col), when compared to the enhancer transgene in a wild type background (control) stained on the same slide (Fig 5A–5E). As anticipated from the selective role of Antp, acting in the thorax, and lbe, in NB5-6T, the dAp neurons were only reduced in the thorax in Antp, and unaffected in lbe (Fig 5A–5D and 5F). In contrast, col mutants affected β-gal expression in both Tv1 and dAp neurons (Fig 5D–5F). Next, we mutated all conserved binding sites for Q50-Homeodomain proteins (TAAT; affecting both Antp and Lbe), Col and Exd (Fig 5M; Materials and Methods; S3 Data and S4 Data). We integrated these mutant transgenes into the same genomic location as the wild type transgenic construct and assayed the expression of β-gal expression in Tv1 and dAp neurons at stage 16. We found that all three mutated enhancers displayed reduced number of Tv1 and dAp cells expressing β-gal, when compared to the enhancer transgene in a wild type background (control) (Fig 5G–5L). We did not analyze the involvement of hth on the ap-CRM (or eya-CRM) because previous studies revealed that hth mutants could be fully rescued by re-expression of col [22]. exd mutants must be analyzed both as maternal and zygotic mutants, and we did not attempt to introduce the ap- and eya-CRM transgenes into such backgrounds.
28414802	FBgn0001235	HTH	For analyzing the ap enhancer, we focused on the smaller apS2J-CRM-lacZ transgene, and placed this in the mutant background for Antp, lbe and col.

28414802	FBgn0000611	EXD	For analyzing the dimm enhancer, we placed the dimm-CRM-GFP transgene in the mutant backgrounds for Antp, ap, col and eya. We observed significant reduction of GFP expression in both Tv1 and dAp neurons in all four mutants, when compared to the enhancer transgene in a wild type background (control) stained on the same slide (S4A–S4G Fig). Next, we mutated all conserved and non-conserved binding sites for Q50-Homeodomain proteins (TAAT; affecting both Ap and Antp), Col and Exd (S5O Fig; Materials and Methods; S3 Data and S4 Data). We integrated these mutant transgenes into the same genomic location as the wild type transgenic construct and assayed the expression of GFP expression in Tv1 and dAp neurons at stage AFT. We found that enhancer mutants for Hox and Exd displayed reduced GFP expression in both Tv1 and dAp cells, when compared to the enhancer transgene in a wild type background (control) (S5H–S5N Fig). In contrast, the Col mutant enhancer showed slightly elevated expression in Tv1 neurons while expression was reduced in dAp neurons (S5J and S5L–S5N Fig).
28414802	FBgn0023091	DIMM	For analyzing the Nplp1 enhancer, we placed the Nplp1-CRM-GFP transgene in the mutant backgrounds for col, ap, eya and dimm. We observed significant reduction of GFP expression in all four mutants, when compared to the enhancer transgene in a wild type background (control) stained on the same slide (Fig 6A–6G). Next, we mutated all possible conserved and non-conserved binding sites for Q50-Homeodomain proteins (TAAT; affecting Ap), Col and Dimm (E-boxes) (Fig 6P; Materials and Methods; S3 Data and S4 Data). We integrated these mutant transgenes into the same genomic location as the wild type transgenic construct and assayed the expression of GFP expression in Tv1 and dAp neurons at stage AFT. We observed that the enhancers mutated for Hox or Dimm sites displayed reduced GFP expression in both Tv1 and dAp cells, when compared to the enhancer transgene in a wild type background (control) (Fig 6H, 6I and 6K–6O). In contrast, the enhancer mutated for Col sites did not display any effect on GFP expression (Fig 6J, 6L and 6M).
28414802	FBgn0267978	AP	Previous studies have revealed that combinatorial misexpression of the transcription factors in the Tv1/dAp cascade is able to broadly activate the genes in the FFL [6, 18, 21, 29, 30]. To determine if such combinatorial ectopic effects could act upon the identified enhancers taken out of genomic context, we misexpressed various combinatorial codes of TFs and studied the effects on the pertinent transgenes. Focusing on the apS2-CRM-lacZ and eya-CRM-GFP, we find broad activation of both transgenes when lbe and col are co-misexpressed (Fig 7A–7D). Similarly, combinatorial misexpression of ap, eya and col could ectopically activate the dimm-CRM-GFP transgene (Fig 7E and 7F). Finally, the Nplp1-CRM-GFP transgene was broadly activated by combinatorial expression of ap, dimm, eya and col (Fig 7G and 7H). In all cases, as anticipated, we observed up-regulation of the endogenous Eya, Dimm and Nplp1 proteins (Fig 7A–7H). These results demonstrate that ectopic activation of the dAp/Tv1 transcriptional program can robustly act upon the identified enhancers even outside their normal genomic context.

28414802	FBgn0001138	GRN	Combining the findings presented in this study, we have been able to molecularly decode the Tv1/dAp genetic FFL cascades [6, 20, 21, 30], bolstering evidence for a complex molecular FFL, based upon sequential transcription factor binding to the downstream genes (Figs 8 and S6). The NB4-3 and NB5-6T neuroblasts are born in different regions of the VNC, and express different spatial determinants i.e., Antp, Lbe, Hth, Exd and Grn [20–22]. As lineage progression commences, they undergo a programmed cascade of transcription factor expression; the temporal cascade [9]. Early temporal factors Kr and Pdm integrate with Grn in NB4-3, while the late temporal factor Cas integrates with Antp, Lbe, Hth and Exd in NB5-6T, to create two distinct combinatorial spatio-temporal codes. These two codes converge on two different enhancers in the col gene, triggering Col expression, and hence the Nplp1 FFL. The FFL, in this case a so-called coherent FFL, where regulators act positively at one or several steps of a cascade, was first identified in E.coli and yeast regulatory networks [31], but have also been identified in C.elegans and Drosophila [6, 32, 33]. Coherent FFLs can act as regulatory timing devices, exemplified by the action of col in NB5-6T: The initial expression of col in Ap cluster cells triggers a generic Ap/Eya interneuron fate in all four cells, while its downregulation in Tv2-4 and maintenance in Tv1 helps propagate the FFL leading to Nplp1 expression [6, 20, 21, 30].

28414802	FBgn0023091	DIMM	Col activates the ap and eya genes. ap encodes a LIM-HD protein, a family of transcription factors well known to control multiple aspects of terminal neuronal subtype fate, including neurotransmitter identity, axon pathfinding and ion channel expression [17, 43–45]. Our results indicate that Ap in turn acts upon dimm, and subsequently with Dimm on Nplp1. eya encodes an evolutionary well-conserved phosphatase and does not bind DNA directly, instead acting as a transcriptional co-factor [46]. Eya (and its orthologues) have been found to interact with several transcription factors in different systems [46], but whether it forms complexes with Col and Ap is not known.
