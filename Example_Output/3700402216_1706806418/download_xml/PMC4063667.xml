<article-title>The POU Factor Ventral Veins Lacking/Drifter Directs the Timing of Metamorphosis through Ecdysteroid and Juvenile Hormone Signaling</article-title>
</related-article><abstract><p>Specialized endocrine cells produce and release steroid hormones that govern development, metabolism and reproduction. In order to synthesize steroids, all the genes in the biosynthetic pathway must be coordinately turned on in steroidogenic cells. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the steroid producing endocrine cells are located in the prothoracic gland (PG) that releases the steroid hormone ecdysone. The transcriptional regulatory network that specifies the unique PG specific expression pattern of the ecdysone biosynthetic genes remains unknown. Here, we show that two transcription factors, the POU-domain Ventral veins lacking (Vvl) and the nuclear receptor Knirps (Kni), have essential roles in the PG during larval development. Vvl is highly expressed in the PG during embryogenesis and is enriched in the gland during larval development, suggesting that Vvl might function as a master transcriptional regulator in this tissue. Vvl and Kni bind to PG specific cis-regulatory elements that are required for expression of the ecdysone biosynthetic genes. Knock down of either <italic>vvl</italic> or <italic>kni</italic> in the PG results in a larval developmental arrest due to failure in ecdysone production. Furthermore, Vvl and Kni are also required for maintenance of TOR/S6K and prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH) signaling in the PG, two major pathways that control ecdysone biosynthesis and PG cell growth. We also show that the transcriptional regulator, Molting defective (Mld), controls early biosynthetic pathway steps. Our data show that Vvl and Kni directly regulate ecdysone biosynthesis by transcriptional control of biosynthetic gene expression and indirectly by affecting PTTH and TOR/S6K signaling. This provides new insight into the regulatory network of transcription factors involved in the coordinated regulation of steroidogenic cell specific transcription, and identifies a new function of Vvl and Knirps in endocrine cells during post-embryonic development.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Steroid hormones play important roles in physiology and disease. These hormones are molecules produced and secreted by endocrine cells in the body and control sexual maturation, metabolism and reproduction. We found transcriptional regulators that underlie the specialized function of endocrine steroid-producing cells. In the steroid-producing cells of the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila</italic>, Ventral veins lacking (Vvl) and Knirps (Kni) turn on all the genes required for steroid production. When Vvl or Kni were inactivated in the cells where the hormone is made, the genes involved in steroid production were not activated. Because of the reduced steroid production, the juvenile larvae failed to develop and undergo maturation to adulthood. Inactivation of Vvl and Kni also reduces endocrine cell growth by disturbing their response to growth promoting signals. Genetic variations in humans with the loss of a homolog of Vvl have been associated with disorders caused by insufficient steroid production. Together with the fact that Vvl is highly expressed in the steroid-producing cells of <italic>Drosophila</italic>, this suggests that Vvl may be a conserved master regulator of steroid production. Our findings provide insight into the network of factors that control endocrine cell function and steroid hormone levels that could have implication for human diseases.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study was financially supported by the Danish Council for Independent Research, Natural Sciences grant 11-105446 to KFR, by the Special Coordination Funds for Promoting Science and Technology of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology of the Japanese Government to RN and NIH grant GM0933301 to MBO.

Specialized endocrine tissues with cell-type specific complements of enzymes that form biochemical pathways mediate the biosynthesis of steroids. In <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae, the steroid biosynthetic enzymes are expressed in the prothoracic gland (PG), the endocrine tissue of insects and the major source of the steroid hormone ecdysone. The production of ecdysone in the PG is regulated by a checkpoint control system in response to external and internal signals <xref rid="pgen.1004343-Rewitz1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. These checkpoints allow the endocrine system to assess growth and nutrient status before activating the biochemical pathway that increases the release of ecdysone, which triggers developmental progression.</p><p>Despite the importance of the coordinated expression in endocrine cells of the steroidogenic enzymes, the PG specific transcriptional regulatory networks that underlie steroidogenic cell function remain unknown. The steroidogenic function of the PG cells is defined by the restricted expression of the genes involved in ecdysone biosynthesis that mediate the conversion of cholesterol to ecdysone. The components of the ecdysone biosynthetic pathway include the Rieske-domain protein Neverland (Nvd) <xref rid="pgen.1004343-Yoshiyama1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004343-YoshiyamaYanagawa1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase Shroud (Sro) <xref rid="pgen.1004343-Niwa1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> and the P450 enzymes Spook (Spo), Spookier (Spok), Phantom (Phm), Disembodied (Dib) and Shadow (Sad) <xref rid="pgen.1004343-Namiki1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1004343-Warren2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> collectively referred to as the Halloween genes.

This is likely orchestrated by multiple transcription factors working in a network to achieve spatial and temporal control of steroid hormone production during development. The composition of this tissue-specific transcriptional regulation remains largely elusive, although some transcription factors are known to regulate ecdysone production in the PG <xref rid="pgen.1004343-Caceres1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>-<xref rid="pgen.1004343-Parvy1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. The nuclear receptor DHR4 functions as a repressor of ecdysone biosynthesis in the PG and responds to prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH) mediated activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway <xref rid="pgen.1004343-Ou1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.

<xref rid="pgen.1004343-Parvy1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. The zing-finger protein Without children (Woc) is required for ecdysone biosynthesis <xref rid="pgen.1004343-Warren3" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, although the pathway component regulated by Woc has not been identified. However, it is unclear if Woc, &#x003b2;FTZ-F1 and DHR4 bind directly to the regulatory regions that control expression of the ecdysone biosynthetic genes. In contrast, we recently showed that the transcription factor Broad (Br) regulates expression of the genes involved in ecdysone biosynthesis by direct binding to their promoters/enhancers <xref rid="pgen.1004343-Moeller1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Although these factors may be important for steroidogenic gene expression, other factors are likely required for the transcriptional regulatory network that defines the PG cell-specific expression of the ecdysone biosynthetic pathway components.</p><p>We recently characterized cis-regulatory elements required for the expression of <italic>phm</italic> and <italic>dib</italic> in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> PG <xref rid="pgen.1004343-Moeller1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, including a 69 bp promoter element located in the upstream <italic>phm</italic> region and a 86 bp region in the third intron of <italic>dib</italic>. These elements are important for the temporal up-regulation of <italic>phm</italic> and <italic>dib</italic> by Br isoform 4 (Br-Z4) that increases the ecdysteroidogenic capacity of the PG and allows the production of the high-level ecdysone pulse that triggers pupariation.

The cis-regulatory elements responsible for PG specific expression of <italic>spok</italic>, <italic>phm</italic> and <italic>dib</italic> contain conserved Vvl and Kni binding sites. Expression of <italic>vvl</italic> is high in the PG compared to the whole animal, while <italic>kni</italic> expression is less PG-specific. Knock down of <italic>vvl</italic> and <italic>kni</italic> in the PG results in larval developmental arrest due to impaired ecdysone production. We show that Vvl and Kni specifically regulate expression of all the ecdysone biosynthetic enzymes through functionally important regulatory sites. Furthermore, we find that Molting defective (Mld) specifically regulates enzymes that catalyze early steps in the ecdysone biosynthetic pathway. Our study identifies Vvl as a PG cell-specific transcription factor that underlies steroidogenic cell function. We conclude that Vvl and Kni are involved in the transcriptional regulatory network of the PG that coordinates expression of biosynthetic enzymes required for ecdysone production during <italic>Drosophila</italic> development.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Regulatory regions of ecdysone biosynthesis genes contain conserved binding sites for Vvl and Kni</title><p>We analyzed the <italic>phm</italic> and <italic>dib</italic> PG specific regulatory elements for transcription factor binding sites.

In contrast, mutations in the non-conserved Kni binding sites do not reduce PG expression. The third intron <italic>dib</italic> enhancer also contains one Vvl site and two Kni sites, both in regions that have been conserved.

The major pathways that are thought to control PG cell growth are the PTTH and the insulin/TOR pathways <xref rid="pgen.1004343-Mirth1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004343-Caldwell1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1004343-McBrayer1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Therefore, we investigated the possibility that Vvl and Kni affect PG cell growth and ecdysone synthesis indirectly by interfering with PTTH and/or insulin/TOR signaling. The neuropeptide, PTTH promotes PG growth and ecdysone synthesis through activation of its receptor Torso, a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) expressed specifically in the PG <xref rid="pgen.1004343-Rewitz4" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Activation of the insulin receptor (InR), another RTK, in the PG also regulates cell growth and stimulates ecdysone synthesis in response to circulating insulin levels. Although crosstalk between systemic insulin mediated growth regulation and TOR signaling might occur, the TOR pathway cell-autonomously regulates growth in response to cellular nutrient levels <xref rid="pgen.1004343-Wullschleger1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. We therefore investigated whether PTTH and insulin/TOR signaling in the gland is affected by knock down of <italic>vvl</italic> and <italic>kni</italic>. Analysis of <italic>torso</italic> transcript levels revealed that, while <italic>mld-RNAi</italic> larvae have normal <italic>torso</italic> mRNA levels, expression of the PTTH receptor is reduced in ring glands from L3 <italic>vvl-RNAi</italic> and <italic>kni-RNAi</italic> larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004343-g006">Fig. 6C</xref>).

However, unlike the biosynthetic enzymes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004343-g003">Fig. 3</xref>), expression of <italic>torso</italic> was not reduced in L1 <italic>phm</italic>&#x0003e;<italic>vvl-RNAi</italic> larvae 36 hours AEL (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004343.s004">Fig. S4</xref>), indicating that <italic>torso</italic> expression is initiated normally despite the loss of <italic>vvl</italic> in the PG. When examining the expression of the <italic>InR</italic> and components mediating insulin signaling, we found reduced expression in <italic>vvl-RNAi</italic> and <italic>kni-RNAi</italic> animals of <italic>4EBP</italic> that encodes a negative growth regulator depressed by activation of the insulin pathway. Further, levels of <italic>akt</italic>, which encodes a serine/threonine kinase of the insulin signaling pathway <xref rid="pgen.1004343-Mirth2" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, were increased, while levels of <italic>InR</italic> were decreased in <italic>vvl-RNAi</italic> larvae. Increased insulin signaling is generally associated with decreased expression of both <italic>4EBP</italic> and <italic>InR</italic>
<xref rid="pgen.1004343-Junger1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004343-Puig1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. These results imply that loss of <italic>vvl</italic> and <italic>kni</italic> increases insulin signaling. The most likely explanation for increased insulin signaling in PG of animals with reduced <italic>vvl</italic> and <italic>kni</italic> expression is the low ecdysone levels, which cause a general increase of insulin release from the brain <xref rid="pgen.1004343-Colombani2" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Thus, the disturbance of insulin signaling in the PG of <italic>vvl-RNAi</italic> and <italic>kni-RNAi</italic> animals seems unlikely to account for the PG cell growth reduction. However, we observed a strong transcriptional reduction of the <italic>S6 kinase</italic> (<italic>S6K</italic>), an important positive growth regulator downstream of TOR. This suggests that the combined reduction of both PTTH/Torso and TOR/S6K signaling in the PG contributes to the negative influence of <italic>vvl-RNAi</italic> and <italic>kni-RNAi</italic> on PG cell growth and ecdysone synthesis. Why does <italic>mld</italic> knock down not affect PG cell size negatively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004343-g006">Fig. 6A and B</xref>)? Since loss of <italic>mld</italic> does not affect <italic>torso</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004343-g006">Fig. 6C</xref>), it is possible that disturbance of the TOR/S6K pathway alone is insufficient to impair growth, especially if this is combined with increased insulin signaling as indicated by the decreased <italic>InR</italic> and <italic>4EBP</italic> mRNA levels in the ring glands of <italic>mld-RNAi</italic> larvae.</p><fig id="pgen-1004343-g006" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1004343.g006</object-id><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>

Down-regulation of biosynthetic activity in <italic>vvl-RNAi</italic>, <italic>kni-RNAi</italic> and <italic>mld-RNAi</italic> larvae reduces cholesterol flux through the ecdysone pathway and may lead to intracellular redistribution of cholesterol to maintain homeostasis through feedback regulation. We therefore explored the possibility that <italic>npc1a</italic>, which is required for normal cholesterol distribution and availability for steroid synthesis, is controlled by feedback regulation of cholesterol. Expression of <italic>npc1a</italic> is repressed by cholesterol in wild type larvae (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004343.s004">Fig. S4</xref>), indicating that <italic>npc1a</italic> is feedback regulated.

<italic>Drosophila</italic> developmental progression is dictated by tightly regulated ecdysone pulses released from the PG. Like any cell specialized for steroid biosynthesis, the PG expresses a set of enzymes that mediate steps in the conversion of cholesterol into steroids. The tissue-specific expression of these enzymes is key to the specialization of the cells that endows the PG with the competence to produce ecdysone. The transcriptional control mechanism underlying such regulation is likely orchestrated by a regulatory network of transcription factors. Here, we identify two transcription factors Vvl and Kni that are required for the expression of the biosynthetic enzymes in the ecdysone producing PG cells. Vvl is a POU domain transcription factor which has multiple important functions during <italic>Drosophila</italic> development. Mutations in <italic>vvl</italic> cause embryonic lethality with defects in the development of the trachea and the nervous system <xref rid="pgen.1004343-Anderson1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1004343-Certel2" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. Moreover, Vvl is required for wing vein development and is involved in innate immunity by regulation of the expression of antimicrobial peptides <xref rid="pgen.1004343-deCelis1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004343-Junell1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. We show that Vvl is expressed in the PG during late embryogenesis and in the larval stages. One important characteristic of Vvl is that it maintains its own expression by autoregulation <xref rid="pgen.1004343-Certel3" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. Once activated, Vvl maintains its expression and likely also the expression of the ecdysone biosynthetic genes in the PG. Knock down of <italic>vvl</italic> in the PG reduces the expression of all genes in the biosynthetic pathway, showing that Vvl is required for maintaining expression of all pathway components. Together with the high expression of Vvl in the gland, this suggests that Vvl is a master transcriptional regulator involved in specifying the genetic program that dictates PG cell identity including its tissue-specific expression of steroidogenic enzymes. It is interesting to note that human chromosome 6 deletions that affect POU3F2, a homolog of Vvl, have been associated with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and adrenal insufficiency <xref rid="pgen.1004343-Bonaglia1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004343-Izumi1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, making it possible that Vvl is a conserved regulator of steroid biosynthesis.</p><p>The gap gene <italic>kni</italic> is known for its role in embryonic segmentation patterning and development of the trachea and wing vein <xref rid="pgen.1004343-Nauber1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1004343-Lunde1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref> similar to <italic>vvl</italic>. Kni is a nuclear receptor with a zinc-finger motif that is unlikely to be ligand activated since it lacks a ligand-binding domain. Our data show that Kni is required for expression of the genes involved in ecdysone biosynthesis in the PG, suggesting that Kni functions as an activator in this situation. Although Kni is generally considered a short-range repressor <xref rid="pgen.1004343-Arnosti1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>, it is required to activate hairy expression in stripe 6 during embryogenesis <xref rid="pgen.1004343-Langeland1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. Thus, Kni may act either as a repressor or as an activator in a context-dependent manner. In mammals, nuclear receptors are also key regulators of steroidogenic target genes encoding P450 enzymes <xref rid="pgen.1004343-Parker1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1004343-Xu1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>.</p><p>Although Vvl and Kni specifically control genes in the steroidogenic pathway, other targets of these factors could also be important for ecdysone synthesis in the PG. During development the continuous growth of the PG cells and endoreplication of DNA is important to scale its hormone production to the capacity required for developmental progression. We found that both <italic>vvl-RNAi</italic> and <italic>kni-RNAi</italic> larvae have mildly reduced PG nuclei and cell size, which is likely to contribute to the reduced ecdysone levels in these animals. Kni has been shown to suppress endoreplication activity in the gut by regulating cell cycle genes <xref rid="pgen.1004343-Fuss1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. This is in contrast to our observation indicating that loss of <italic>kni</italic> results in a reduction in the nuclei size, and hence, reduced polyploidy of the PG cells. Instead our results indicate that loss of <italic>vvl</italic> and <italic>kni</italic> reduces activity of PTTH/Torso and TOR/S6K signaling, two major pathways that promote growth and stimulate ecdysone biosynthesis <xref rid="pgen.1004343-Ghosh1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004343-Layalle1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004343-Rewitz4" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004343-Gibbens1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>. However, loss of <italic>vvl</italic> and <italic>kni</italic> had no effect on <italic>torso</italic> expression in the mid-first instar. This indicates that these factors are not required for the initial setting of <italic>torso</italic> expression, but for the maintenance of high <italic>torso</italic> expression during development. In tracheal cells, Vvl is required to maintain expression of the RTK <italic>breathless</italic>, but not for activating its initial expression <xref rid="pgen.1004343-deCelis1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004343-Anderson2" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>. It is unclear how the transcription of the biosynthetic enzymes fluctuates during the low level ecdysone peaks in L1 and L2, before the induction of the steroidogenic pathway by PTTH stimulation <xref rid="pgen.1004343-Ou1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Unlike PTTH/Torso, Vvl and Kni are required in the PG during L1 and L2 for the transition to the L3 stage, which suggests that Vvl and Kni are important for the proper transcription of the biosynthetic enzymes throughout larval development. Altogether, these data suggest that in addition to being required to initiate and maintain expression of the biosynthetic enzymes, Vvl and Kni play an indirect role important for ecdysone production by enabling PG cells to be competent to respond to PTTH and by regulating the TOR/S6K pathway. In contrast, Vvl and Kni are not required for normal expression of <italic>EcR</italic> in the gland, indicating that feedback regulation of ecdysone biosynthesis is not influenced by knock down of these factors <xref rid="pgen.1004343-Moeller1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. In contrast to the transcription factor <italic>Br-Z4</italic> involved in positive feedback regulation, which is strongly induced in the PG during late L3 to up-regulate expression of the biosynthetic pathway components, PG expression of <italic>vvl</italic> shows little relation with the high-level ecdysone peak that triggers pupariation. Taken together these data suggest that Vvl is required for maintaining PG specific expression (i.e. spatial control), while temporal regulation during development is controlled by other factors such as Br-Z4. Furthermore, our results confirm that Mld is required for PG expression of <italic>spok</italic>
<xref rid="pgen.1004343-Ono1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, but we also found that it controls Nvd, an enzyme that acts upstream of Spok in the biosynthetic pathway <xref rid="pgen.1004343-Yoshiyama1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Thus, our data suggest that Mld is a specific regulator of the two early enzymes Nvd and Spok, while its function is not important for biosynthetic reactions that are downstream of Spok and the black box reaction(s) and the responsiveness of the PG to PTTH.</p><p>Our data show that Vvl and Kni are required in the PG during post-embryonic development to maintain PG specific expression of the ecdysone biosynthetic genes. During embryogenesis, <italic>vvl</italic> expression appears in the PG primordium by stage 13, after the embryonic ecdysone pulse (stage 8&#x02013;12 <xref rid="pgen.1004343-Warren2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>) that is required for morphogenesis and differentiation of the embryo. During early embryonic development where the PG primordium is not yet formed, the spatial expression patterns of <italic>kni</italic> and <italic>vvl</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004343-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>) are different from the biosynthetic genes essential for the embryonic ecdysone pulse <xref rid="pgen.1004343-Niwa2" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004343-Ono1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004343-Warren1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004343-Warren2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004343-Chavez1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>. This suggests that Vvl and Kni regulate the biosynthetic genes in the PG, but not during early embryonic development. Consistent with this notion, <italic>vvl</italic> and <italic>kni</italic> mutants differentiate the embryonic cuticle <xref rid="pgen.1004343-deCelis1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004343-Jurgens1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>, unlike the ecdysone deficient mutants that are unable to produce the embryonic ecdysone peak <xref rid="pgen.1004343-Warren1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004343-Chavez1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>. In adult females, the ovaries are believed to be the source of ecdysone consistent with expression of the ecdysone biosynthetic genes in the nurse and/or follicle cells <xref rid="pgen.1004343-Warren1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1004343-Petryk1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. In adult females, we find that <italic>vvl</italic> is expressed in both nurse and follicle cells, suggesting that Vvl may be involved in regulating expression of the ecdysone biosynthetic genes in the adult stage.</p><p>Interestingly, we observed that loss of <italic>vvl</italic>, <italic>kni</italic> or <italic>mld</italic> results in dramatic increase of <italic>npc1a</italic> expression in the PG. Npc1a is highly expressed in the PG where it is required for uptake and intracellular trafficking of cholesterol for steroidogeneis <xref rid="pgen.1004343-Huang1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Larvae with loss of <italic>npc1a</italic> exhibit a punctuate pattern of sterol accumulation in the PG cells, indicating defects in cholesterol transport within the cells. Normally cholesterol is taken up as low density lipoproteins (LDLs) and trafficked within endosomes to the lysosomes where hydrolysis releases free cholesterol that is delivered to the plasma membrane and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) <xref rid="pgen.1004343-Du1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref> where the first step in the conversion of cholesterol to ecdysone likely takes place. Why is <italic>npc1a</italic> up-regulated in the PG when ecdysone synthesis and pathway activity is impaired? It seems unlikely that Vvl, Kni and Mld are all involved in repression of <italic>npc1a</italic>. The block of flux through the biosynthetic pathway in the PG of <italic>vvl-RNAi</italic>, <italic>kni-RNAi</italic> and <italic>mld-RNAi</italic> animals may change intracellular cholesterol pools in the gland and affect feedback regulation to maintain cholesterol homeostasis. Our results indicate that <italic>npc1a</italic> is regulated by cholesterol suggesting that the up-regulation of <italic>npc1a</italic> may be part of a feedback regulatory response to changes in cellular cholesterol levels. This may indicate a compensatory mechanism to redistribute cholesterol by increasing storage of cholesterol esters and/or efflux to reduce free cholesterol levels when ecdysone biosynthesis is blocked. Moreover, <italic>npc1a</italic> is regulated by Br <xref rid="pgen.1004343-Xiang1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, a factor induced by EcR in the PG <xref rid="pgen.1004343-Moeller1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, implying that <italic>ncp1a</italic> may also be regulated by ecdysone feedback. Our study shows that cholesterol availability is an important parameter for ecdysone biosynthesis. Interactions between cholesterol and ecdysone feedback mechanisms may therefore be important for coordinating the supply cholesterol with the rate of steroidogenesis.</p><p>A key aspect of steroidogenesis is regulating the tissue-specific expression of the biosynthetic enzymes. We have shown here that the transcription factors, Vvl and Kni, are required for the coordinated expression of ecdysone biosynthetic genes in the PG.
